This is a project idea for the [[Automatically Defined Functions|ADF subteam]]. This will be an ongoing project to analyze the effects of ADFs on the primitives in a population. As more experiments are run there will be more data to analyze, but good organization of scripts will keep automation easy.

=== Current Work ===
This project was already started in order to get distributions of primitive frequencies in populations for our midterm presentation. We got to the point where we can see distributions of single runs, but we want to look across multiple runs. For more information on the current progress you can look at the [https://github.gatech.edu/gwang340/emade/blob/Stats_ADF/notebooks/string_parsing.py string_parsing.py] file on Gabe's repo. You can talk to [[Notebook Aaron McDaniel|Aaron McDaniel]] or [[Notebook Gabriel Qi Wang|Gabe]] for a description of the code.

Work That Needs to be Done
* Repeat the process of getting primitive frequencies for multiple schemas (this will not take long)
* Find more ways to compare the effects of ADFs on the population
* Automate the process of collecting these comparisons for analyzing future data
