== Overview ==

Welcome to the Automated Algorithm Design VIP team's wiki page! Here you will find some useful information about the team.

Advisors: 
* Dr. Jason Zutty (GTRI) - Jason.Zutty@gtri.gatech.edu
* Dr. Greg Rohling (GTRI) - Greg.Rohling@gtri.gatech.edu

Partners & Sponsors:
* Grand Challenges [http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges/discovery.aspx | Engineer the Tools of Scientific Discovery ]

=== Schedule ===
* Class Location: Klaus 1440  
* Class/Team Meeting Time:   
**Monday, 5:00-5:50 pm (Returning students)  
**Wednesday, 5:00-5:50 pm (New students)
* Additional breakout/working session times will be identified.

=== Team Goals ===
To develop a framework that fundamentally alters the development of algorithms.  We desire to create an automated method that starts with the best human algorithms and then dispassionately develops hybrid algorithms that outperform existing methods. And then prove that these algorithms can also be studied by humans for inspiration in development of new algorithm and optimization methods.

== Current Semester (Spring 2022) ==

=== Semester Notes and Updates ===
We continue to tweak some components to help improve the course process and legacy.  Some changes for the semester are:
# '''Piazza for questions:''' We will continue to utilize Slack for team communication, but for technical questions we will be using Piazza this semester so we have some easy to reference material. The link for our Piazza is: piazza.com/gatech/fall2020/vip4602vvk 
# '''Notebooks maintained on Wiki:'''   Notebooks will continue to be kept on the wiki.  This will provide the ability to search notebooks of your and your peers for the foreseeable future even across semester boundaries. It also provides the ability to check progress on notebooks throughout the semester.  Coupled with unannounced checks we hope to make sure that notebooks are being maintained properly and timely. Notebooks should include links to code commits and resources. Remember if you didn't document it, you didn't do it. 
# '''Sub-team weekly reports:'''  At the beginning of each class, each sub-team will provide a short (no more than 2 minutes per sub-team) summary of their progress for the week.   The purpose is to make sure progress is occurring, that any issues can be resolved quickly, and that the boot-camp students have some visibility into each group.  These reports will be maintained on the wiki, and will contain:
#* Progress from previous week
#* Any current issues
#* Plans for next week.
# '''Bootcamp deliverables:'''  Instead of bootcamp projects exclusively using presentations as deliverables, most deliverables will be in report form, and some in presentation form.  The purpose of this modification to encourage written skills in addition to presentation skills.  This also provides for additional in-class time to focus on the topics as opposed to presentations.
# '''Save The Dates:''' 
## Presentations are being held in two long sections this semester.  Each will involve all students.  As we are remote this semester, we will not have our usual food provided.
##* '''Monday, March 14 - 5:00 to 8:00pm.  Location Klaus 1440''' 
##** Presentations from First Semester sub-teams on EMADE results w/ comparisons to GP and ML
##** Presentations from Returning sub-teams on progress, and recruitment.  Time for discussions with groups
##* '''Friday, April 29 - 6:00 to 8:50pm. Location Klaus 1440'''
##** Final Presentations from each group
