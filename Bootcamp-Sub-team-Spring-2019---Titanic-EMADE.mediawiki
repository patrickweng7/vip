* At the beginnign we had errors getting EMADE to run
* "Validate lengths" error by scikit-image
** solved by installing scikit image using pip and specifying vresion 0.14.
*** Thanks James!

* Also had an issue with connecting wiht mysql
** SSL connection error
** James helped us fix it by adding pymysql
* Trained for 14 generations
* The Viz team helped us visualize some of the data

Oscar Aguilar, Zack Butler, Eric Frankel, and [[Notebook_Yuhang_Li#Mar_11.2C_2019|William Li]]
* Ran EMADE with William's computer as master and Oscar and Eric as workers, Zack had problems connecting because he lives off campus
* Looked at Pareto Front for the last generation and plots of AUC and best individual over time (below)
* We computed best individual as one with minimal euclidean distance to the origin when plotting false negatives vs. false positives

==Group 3==
*We were able to successfully run Emade with Nicole's computer as the master and Sarthak's as a worker
*Shlok was getting a server error and couldn't set up mysql
*We made a Pareto Front for the 30th generation year
*Note that the area under the curve (.13659) is better than that of our GP Pareto Front (.2310)

** Ran for 39 generations over two weeks
** Seeded with a random forest individual
** May be better optimized if ran for more generations
** Created the most possible combinations of algorithms/individuals
** Least amount of data cleaning, removed human bias
** Evaluation time increases over generations
** Longest amount of time compared to other models with a limited computational power.
** Individuals in the database: 8570
** Individuals evaluated: 7632
** Individuals with non-null scores: 1200
** Individuals used from last generation: 56
** Area Under Curve: 0.913877551020408
