Evolutionary Algorithm Design:
* Our primitive set consisted of the add, subtract, multiply, negative, greater than, less than and square operators taken from NumPy.
* Created wrapper for greater, less than: default NumPy methods do not interact well with negative
* Fitness is measured using false positives and false negatives

* We chose the mating probabilities to be higher  (0.75) when one or more of the individuals in hand are on the Pareto frontier.
* We gave each offspring a (0.3) chance to mutate

Takeaways:
* Data points on the frontier very close to each other: all classifiers obtained decent results
* Higher AUC: globally less accurate than MOGP results
* Each method has a fair share of false positives and false negative
* Data points on the frontier are more spread apart
* Pareto frontier obtained from last generation of GP algorithm
* We can observe three clusters: with more FP, with more FN, and an equal amount of both
* Some Pareto frontier individuals have a very strong tendency towards predicting 1 or 0
* Lower AUC: globally more accurate on this specific dataset

=== Titanic ML ===
*Cleaned data by
**Adding one hot encoded "title" where title was the title of a person selected from their name
**Changed embarked to one hot encoding
**Average age of missing ages was replaced by the average age for people with some title
**Embarked was replaced with the mode where missing
**Name / Embarked / Cabin / Ticket were removed
*Seung Je jung
Used SVM classifier
*SVM classifier managed an accuracy of 84.4% with 15% FPR and 15% FNR
*Used poly kernel
*[[files/Svmcode.png|none|thumb|892x892px]]
*[[files/Cnfsnmatrix.png|none|thumb]]

* Tanishq Sandhu
** Used Stochastic Gradient Descent
** Default values proved to be better but changed the iterations to 90 because default = 1000 iterations
*** My Github link for my Lab 4 in which I used Stochastic  Gradient Descent : https://github.com/tanishqsandhu/AutomatedAlgorithmDesign/blob/master/Labs/titanic_solution.py 
[[files/Tanishq1.png|none|thumb]]
** As shown above, I had an accuracy of 81.02% with a 12.2% FPR and 6.78% FPR

=== Titanic GP ===
* Used the same data as the sci-kit models
* Decided on strongly-typed GP because our inputs were normalized floats and our output was a boolean
* Used 3 types of primitives: boolean, floating point, and logic operators
** [[files/WeARSgzdhftyjuugytrefds.png|none|thumb|502x502px]]
* Used genHalfAndHalf, selTournament, cxOnePoint, and mutUniform for the expr, select, mate, and mutate methods respectively
* Evaluation function returned false positives/positives and false negatives/negatives when our test data was put through the tree[[files/Evaluation function titanic gp.png|none|thumb|518x518px]]
* Did a random search for optimal population size, mutation rate, and mating rate, and ended up setting them to 400, .8, and .3 respectively
** mutation and mating rate seemed to have very little effect on the final result
* Produced a Pareto front with an AUC of 0.161, but it was very sparse[[files/Titanic GP Pareto Front.png|none|thumb]]
* Potential improvements can be made by testing different mating, mutation, and selection functions, along with different inputs, but we ran out of time due to technical difficulties with tree visualization.
