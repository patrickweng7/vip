==Team Members:==
''Eashan Sinha / Elan Grossman / Leul Wubete / Jessi Chen / Pranav Pusarla''
* We're Number 1!!!!

==Sept. 25, 2021 - Titanic: Continued ==
* Team 1 has been progressing on finishing our Bootcamp project.
* We have discussed and used potential algorithms that have been able to reduce our AUC, smaller than that of the ML data.
* We wrote a select_tournament algorithm since the original selTournament does not work in Multiobjective!
* Presentation slides have been started, we have the presentations outlined and we are ready to include our information on the slides.

* Things we have discussed during our meetings over the last week:
  - How to split up the slide presentation work
  - How to preprocess the data given from the CSV files so we can successfully run our algorithms and
  - What is Strongly Typed GP vs Loosely Typed?
  - Had a great discussion on Slack clarifying how to draw and calculate AUC in a minimization Pareto Front
  - Produced a comparison graph of Pareto Fronts comparing the ML to our algorithm.

==Sept. a7 - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster:==
* The team had their first out-of-class meeting on 09/19/2021, it was legendary. We discussed SciKit learn as well as the provided Jupyter Notebook.
* We discussed one-hot encoding and how we could use it in the dataset generation to model categorial variables such as Sex and Port of Embarkment. By using the getdummies() api in Pandas, we were able to modify those variables to each be their own column with values 0 and 1. The rest of the test set generation was left largely the same
* Next, we picked which classifies each person would use, as described below.
