''Eashan Sinha / Elan Grossman / Leul Wubete / Jessi Chen / Pranav Pusarla''
* We're Number 1!!!!

==Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster:==
* The team had their first out-of-class meeting on 09/19/2021, it was legendary. We discussed SciKit learn as well as the provided Jupyter Notebook.
* We discussed one-hot encoding and how we could use it in the dataset generation to model categorial variables such as Sex and Port of Embarkment. By using the getdummies() api in Pandas, we were able to modify those variables to each be their own column with values 0 and 1. The rest of the test set generation was left largely the same
* Next, we picked which classifies each person would use, as described below.
