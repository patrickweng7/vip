== Overview ==
Our sub-team focuses on making the process of utilizing the tools that EMADE provides simpler, more efficient, and overall easier to understand. The goal is to ensure that any entering or current member can find all the necessary information to be successful in their endeavors.

=== Current Projects and Goals ===
----The immediate focus of our group is to clarify the most confusing areas of the process underwent by the first semester students in order to improve the experience of any future members. We hope that with each new semester we will be able to streamline our procedure until the integration process is clear cut and most problems can be anticipated through documented precedent.

With this goal in mind, our current projects are as follows:
# Updated and Comprehensive Installation Instructions
#* We found that a lot of the confusion during the installation process stemmed from either instructions that were not updated to match the newer versions, discrepancies between the user type, or failure to identify the key points during the procedure.
#* Separate instructions were created for Windows, Mac, and Linux users so that differentiation would be simple.
# Consolidated mySQL Commands
#* Many students will not join this VIP with a background in SQL, so the basic commands for a new user, along with descriptions and example code have been provided.
# Background Resources
#* This includes articles and websites to pair with the lecture material, instructions on how to use common tools in machine learning, and explanations of the basic commands to easily manage GitHub.

=== Future Projects ===
----Once we have optimized the integration process for new students, we want to continue by documenting actual EMADE features, including those that have been added more recently so that modification will be simpler and progress can be made more quickly without extensive review of code prior to the start of any project.
