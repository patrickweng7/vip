===Overview===

----

In an attempt to maximize profit, the stock market subteam will be applying genetic programming in two ways. First we will be optimizing a binary classification problem using EMADE. Combining EMADE with the technical indicators we have already created we want to determine which indicators work well as features for a particular stock. We also want to use EMADE to produce relevant combinations of technical indicators that can be coded into the portfolio optimization problem. For the portfolio optimization problem we are going to use GP/GA to select technical indicators which will be used to represent states for a Q-Learner. The Q-Learner will be trained/tested and return the value of the portfolio at the end of the test set to represent the fitness of that state space.

===Sub-Teams and Goals===

----

[[Technical Indicator Optimization]] (New Page for Indicator Optimization Sub-team):<br>
* Run optimization on multiple stocks to determine which indicators work best on which stocks.
* Analyze results to look for interesting combinations of indicators that could be fed to the portfolio team.
* Expand capabilities of EMADE by coding more technical indicators throughout the semester.

[[Portfolio Optimization]] <br>
* Create a new code base that will be used for the optimization process.
* Optimize multiple different sets of stocks, compare the optimized (state, Deep Q-Learner) pair against a stock index such as S&P 500
* Run EMADE with the Deep Q-Learner on real time stock data
