== Introduction ==
Throughout our time working with EMADE, our team members noticed a few things:
# There was a large amount of data simply being printed out onto the console. There was so much information that it was almost useless to users, especially when EMADE was being run across multiple servers and individuals were being evaluated fairly quickly.
# There was no way to visualize generational performance or what was going on "under the hood" live, while EMADE was running.
# There were ubiquitous visualizations, such as non-dominated over time and individual trees, that had to manually be created.
We realized that EMADE visualization was an area with major opportunity for improvement, so we created the EMADE Visualization Team. Getting inspiration from [https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard TensorBoard], we made it our goal to build a web application that will enrich the EMADE user experience by providing visualizations of EMADE performance and individual models in real-time.

== Our Work ==
# Established team communication, set up project management tools, created a GitHub repository for the code base
# Created mockups for visualizations that we wanted to implement
# Found resources that would be needed for implementation
# Built a Flask website with templates for the visualizations
# Acquired a database with a large amount of EMADE data that we could use to build visualizations
# Built Python code to visualize non-dominated front over generations
# Built Python code to visualize an individual
To see our work, visit our [https://github.gatech.edu/adachille3/emade-viz GitHub]. We have also attached one of our mockups below.[[files/Non-dominated-individual.png|alt=non dominated individual mockup|thumb|679x679px|none]]

Some of our output graphs on the titanic dataset are included below. You can see that for the first couple of generations, the FP / FN scores return null and thus the pareto front contains no members. As evolution continues, the front condenses.

== For the Future ==
* Add ability to connect to a database from the website so that live updates can be made
* Integrate visualization code for non-dominated front over generations into website
* Integrate visualization code for individual tree into website
