=== First Semester Teams ===

=== Sub Team Projects ===
[[EMADE Visualization Subteam]]

[[EMADE Stock Subteam]]

[[EMADE EEG Subteam]]

[[EMADE DEEP Subteam]]

=== Interesting Readings ===
=== Introduction to Git Version Control System and FAQ ===
[http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ Simple Introductory Guide to Git, with graphical illustrations and installation]

==== Git Large File System ====
After following the introduction to Git installation and basic commands, it is also recommended to install git-lfs to handle EMADE installation.

==== Windows ====
Follow the manual installation on the [https://git-lfs.github.com/ Git website.]

==== Mac ====
Install either Homebrew or MacPorts package manager for MacOS. Either one is sufficient for EMADE and related Python packages.

[https://www.howtogeek.com/211541/homebrew-for-os-x-easily-installs-desktop-apps-and-terminal-utilities/ Installing Homebrew (recommended)]

[https://www.macports.org/install.php Installing MacPorts]

Then, install Git Large File System (LFS) by running the following commands in Terminal (sudo may be required):

Homebrew: brew install git-lfs 

MacPorts: port install git-lfs

==== Linux ====
For Debian distributions (particularly Ubuntu 16.04), run the following two commands:

curl -s <nowiki>https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh</nowiki> | sudo bash

sudo apt-get install git-lfs

[https://askubuntu.com/questions/799341/how-to-install-git-lfs-on-ubuntu-16-04 Source]

=== Recommended Package Versions  ===
While other versions may work, to be consistent with EMADE and the first semester projects, it is recommended to install these software versions.

Generally, use Anaconda's virtual environment if possible. Otherwise, use pip and your preferred package manager.

For Windows users, the GUI installers are recommended.

'''NOTE: The minor versions (e.g. 3.5.xx) generally do not matter.'''
