This page is the main resource for documenting the ideas and efforts of the EMADE Feature Enhancement Subteam.

=== Goals ===
----
Our overall goal is to improve EMADE by adding new features and improving existing ones.

==== Feature Ideas ====
* New genetic algorithm methods (selection, mating, mutation)
* Usability Improvements
** Configuration improvements
** Live monitoring through GUI
* Performance Improvements
** Reduce bloating
** Add and improve caching

=== Features ===
----
==== Genetic Algorithm Methods ====
We wish to implement existing or novel selection, mating, and mutation algorithms for use in EMADE. We are specifically interested in methods that are probabilistic in nature, similar to the search method of simulated annealing.

==== Usability Improvements ====
We wish to improve the usability and utility of EMADE by adding resources to make problem set-up faster and more efficient, and by adding GUI utilities for live monitoring of EMADE processes and statistics.

==== Performance Improvements ====
We wish to increase the performance of EMADE by improving the existing code-base with optimizations, and by adding new performance-focused features such as algorithm bloat reduction, and efficient caching mechanisms.
