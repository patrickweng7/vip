'''Team: EEG''' 

'''Summary:'''
During the Fall Semester of 2018, as a part of the EEG team, I first worked together with the rest of the first semeseter students in creating an individual, running emade, with the EEG Lesion data. This was a simpler problem than our overall goal, but it was a step in the right direction. After we were able to create "good individual", I worked with Scott, Joel, and Suraj to help run emade on Google Cloud. We were able to run Emade on the cloud, and I personally created a worker on my own instance that ran for 8 hours to our central Cloud database. For the last part of the semseter, I worked with team to create our presentation.
