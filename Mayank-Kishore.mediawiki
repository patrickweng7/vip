Semester: 2nd Semester of VIP

Contributions During Fall 2018:
* During the semester I spent a lot of time working with the Portfolio Optimization subteam
* Started by working with Michael and James to determine what was necessary for implementing the QLearners
* It is about this time that my laptop stopped working so I worked closely with Michael to conduct research on the QLearners
* Worked on developing the evaluation function for the QLearner as well
* Worked with Sierra and Kirtan to add the evaluation function and create a preprocessing function for new datasets
* Helped Sierra research new datasets that can be used in the future
* Working towards getting the ability to handle more stocks
* Worked on the wiki by contributing a new page for our the subteam
* Detailed our weekly accomplishments and posted numerous resources that will be useful for anyone looking to learn more about our subteam's work
* Worked on making sure everything was very visible
Overall, I really enjoyed learning more about Deep Learning in an environment that sits outside of a traditional classroom. I am looking forward to learning more and implement the multiple stocks optimization so that the project can begin to really take off. I loved the learning and I am incredibly excited about the future use cases of EMADE. Have a wonderful break!
