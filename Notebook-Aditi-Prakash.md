## Team Meeting Notes
### Lecture on Genetic Algorithms
Introduced concept of genetic algorithms that mimic evolutionary processes (mutation, selection, mating, fitness evaluation, reproduction ,etc.) in order to maximize the fitness of individuals in a population of data. Learned genetic algorthm solution to One Max Problem - a simple problem that presents the goal of maximizing the number of 1's that an individual contains (thereby maximizing the sum of the individual's bits).
