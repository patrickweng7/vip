=== Lecture Notes: ===
*  First week back; reintroduced to VIP by Dr. Zutty and Dr. Roehling. 
*  Decided subteams, Dr. Roehling introduced a possible new idea for scoliosis data processing, which I found interesting.
*  Broke into breakout rooms, I joined the scoliosis study team.
*  Joined the team slack, reported my availability times for team meetings.
*  We decided that we'd read the research papers shared by Dr. Roehling before the 24th of January, and prepare any questions we have about scoliosis.
*  A meeting is scheduled with the hospital on the 24th, which will be our introduction to the project.

=== Individual Notes: ===
*  Updated notebook, linked second notebook to original.
