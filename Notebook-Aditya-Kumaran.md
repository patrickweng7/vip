'''Lecture Notes:'''
* Learned about project requirements: Anaconda, JupyterLab, Python deap
* Introduced to EMade's GitHub, Wiki, Personal Progress Notebooks, Python Jupyter Notebooks, Slack
* Introduced to Genetic Algorithms:
    *  Allegories for how DNA works.
    *  Many solutions to your problem, each being a “genome” and can mutate either individually or in groups 
* "Individual"
    *  Specific candidate in the population
    *  Like one person's DNA
* "Population"
    *  Group of individuals that will be altered
* "Objective"
    *  Performance measure of individual
    *  Is an objective measurement, not relative
* "Fitness"
    *  Relative measure of performance
* "Evaluation"
    *  Computes the objective of an individual
* "Selection"
    *  Gives preference to better individuals to pass on their genes
    *  Can be:
        *  Fitness Proportionate = fitness value is proportional to the probability of being selected for mating
        *  Tournament = from a group of individuals, the winner (best individual) is selected for mating. More random than fitness proportionate.
* "Mating"/"Crossover"
    *  Represents mating between individuals, in that DNA is taken from both places
    *  Can be a single point splice, double point splice, etc.
* "Mutation"
    *  Making a small change to an individual (changing a person's DNA)
    *  Purpose is to maintain diversity
* Algorithms
    *  Initialize population
    *  Evaluate population to get objective, fitness
    *  Loop through:
        1. Select parents
        2. Mating actions
        3. Mutations
        4. Determine fitness
        5. (until the best individual is acceptable)
