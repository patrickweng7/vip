* Learned different ways to complete analysis of the individuals
* We currently do not have a tradeoff space for pareto frontier due to the fact that both objectives have the exact same values
* Looking into ways to implement the statistics lecture to the individuals created from the recent runs
'''Individual Notes'''

* Others are also struggling to get valid individuals
* Potential reasons
* Objective functions return the same metric?
* Problem with feature extraction?
* Seeded individuals not propagating?

Group Meeting Notes:
* Learned about different statistics with Dr. Zutty
* Learned how to analyze data with statistics
* Reviewed over what the following terms mean (mean, variance, and standard deviation)
* Hypothesis Testing: Compute the probability of finding a sample at some extreme (known as p-value)
* The threshold to reject the hypothesis is based on a value of alpha (commonly used alpha of 0.05)
* Using the t-statistic - distance from the mean by the standard deviation (use the t-table)
* Can find the p-value from the t-statistic (python scipy)
* Best to use 2-tailed t test for statistical analysis
'''Individual Notes'''

* Currently getting no valid individuals
* Look into it more and ask next week

* I messed with the different parameters to get the best performance
* I found that some of the parameters had more effect on the overall performance
* I was getting a low false positive number, but a relatively high false negative number
* After changing a few things, I got better numbers
* I ended up having to change it completely because it was not co-dominant
* Changed the parameters to get a low false negative instead of a low false positive, due to the fact that one of my team members had a false positive number of 1

=== Lab 2 Part 2 ===
* Minimizing multiple objectives
* The fitness and generation graph does not accurately show us how well the population is doing with both objectives
** This could be strongly bias towards one objective
* This is why we use the Pareto Front graph with an objective on each axis
* Terminals are pre-defined constants for our individuals
* Be careful to not define primitives and terminals our trees cannot produce
** This will lead to errors when trying to evolve our population
* To prevent bloat we use statics limits

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''

Diversity is the idea that the population is not the same (we want this)

Genetic Programming
* Instead of taking an individual and having a function evaluator to obtain objective scores
** Individual to the evaluator to objective score vs Input data to the individual to output data to the evaluator
* The individual is now the function itself
** The objective score becomes the error Tree Representation
** Can represent a program as a tree structure
*** Nodes are called primitives and represent functions
*** Leaves are called terminals and represent parameters
**** The input can be thought of as a particular type of terminal
**** The output is produced by .....
How is a tree store
* The tree is converted to a lisp preordered parse tree
** Operator followed by inputs
* Crossover with GP
** Subtrees are exchanged to produced children (exchanged at operator)
** Only single-point crossover
* Mutation in GP
** Inserting a node or subtree
** Deleting a node or subtree
** Changing a node
* Evaluating a tree
** We can feed a number of input points into the function to get outputs
** Run f(x)
** We can measure the error between outputs and truth

=== '''Lab 2 Part 1''' ===
Primitive Set
* A group of various operations for primitive are used to create new functions
Generating a Function With Genetic Programming Lessons
* Individuals will be represented as a tree structure
* Primitive set and the primitives we can use
* What changing the max and min does
* Not trying to fit a function to data, we are trying to generate a specific output

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''

Genetic Algorithm - Bio-Inspired

Genetic algorithm for each new generation is created through mating/mutation of individuals in the previous population. Then fitness is evaluated. Through numerous operations of this process, it will eventually produce the best individual - one whose fitness is better than everyone else's in the population and cannot get any better. (This is the end goal).
* How this process works
# Have initial Population
# Evaluate every individual in the population
# Reach some stopping criteria
# If not reach the stopping criteria, then continue on to...
# Selection (Next-generation parents)
# Crossover (Analogy for mating) to create children
# Mutation (make small changes to the created children)
* (Follows the same steps of Evolution)
Some important '''Keywords''' are
* Individual - one specific candidate in the population (with properties such as DNA)
* Population - a group of individuals whose properties will be altered
* Objective - a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize (normally a score) (Such as a score on a test)
* Fitness - relative comparison to other individuals how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to the rest of the population (similar to objective) (Such as the curve on the test) also similar to Relative placement - how good are you relative to everyone else in the population
* Evaluation - a function that computes the objective of an individual
* Selection - represents ‘survival of the fittest’: gives preference to better individuals, therefore allowing them to pass on their genes
** Fitness Proportionate - the greater the fitness value the higher the probability of being selected for mating (Random chance)(Slice of the pie of how well their objective fits into the rest of the population) (Each wedge of the pie is related to the fitness) (Roulette wheel selection)
** Tournament - several tournaments among individuals (number of individuals in each tournament is dependent on tournament size); winners are selected for mating (More random than fitness proportionate)

* Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals (Single Point and Double Point) (for example 111111 and 222222 could turn into 111222 in a single point) (and 112211 in double point)

* Mutate - Introduces random modification; purpose is to maintain diversity (Change a single gene) (for example 111111 to 111110)

* Algorithms - various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual
# Randomly initialize population
# Determine fitness of the population
## Find objective score
## Find out the objective scores compare to everyone else
# Repeat
## Select parents form population
## Perform crossover on parents creating a population
## Perform mutation of population
## Determine fitness of the population
* This process is repeated until we get an individual that is “good enough” or we meet a solution we like.
One Max Problem Example

Individuals have a list of one hundred values that are either 0 or 1

Objective value is the sum of all of the values in the list

The end goal is to produce an individual whose list contains all one’s (Objective value of 100)

=== '''Lab 1 - Genetic Algorithms with DEAP''' ===
Using the DEAP library gives us tools to solve the given problems

Creator and Toolbox are important tools in DEAP

'''Before Steps of a Genetic Algorithm'''
* Define the class, objectives, and fitness
* Define the individuals in the population
* Define the population as a list of individuals
* Evaluate the individual's fitness using the fitness objective previously defined
* Define the functions (in this case evaluate, mate, mutate, and select)
'''Steps of a Genetic Algorithm'''
* Define the main genetic algorithm and create the population (300 in this case)
* Evaluate each of the individuals in the population and get their fitness values

* Define the evolutionary loop and how many times we want it to run (40 generations in this case)
** In this case (Run a tournament, complete crossover and mutation)
** Re-evaluate the offspring and replace the old population

* Define statics for the population and print them
