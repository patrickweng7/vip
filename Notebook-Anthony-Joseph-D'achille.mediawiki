'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* We split into two sub-teams: User Study, and Coding
* User Study Brainstorming
** Get documentation for those who want to run it locally 
** Host site on Heroku
** Testing out website with live data
** Create survey with questions about Viz tool
* Coding Brainstorming
** Refactoring code and making it extensible
** Improve aesthetics of website
** Change EMADE code so that each individual has references to its parents
** Visualization of the ancestral lineage in phenotypic/objective space (i.e., what was the objective scores of the parents/grandparents that resulted in the current individual)
** Visualization of the ancestral lineage in genotypic/tree structure space (i.e., what parts of an individual came from each of the parents)
** Visualization of the evolutionary processes, (i.e. what mutations, selections, mating are occurring that are positive, and which are detrimental?)
** How many times is an individual selected over time? 
** How productive are their offspring, i.e. are they dominate or co-dominate to the parents or population?
** How many Pareto individuals are there over time?

== Week 3: January 21 - January 27, 2019 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Progress from last week
** Suraj
*** Got it running
** Sierra
*** Got it running and connected to DB
** Anthony
*** Got Viz running again
*** Got website up on Heroku account! <nowiki>https://emade-viz.herokuapp.com/</nowiki>
** Michael
*** Got it running and connected to my database
*** Changed one line for strict slashes (for linux)
** Jeffrey
*** Got Viz running
*** Created a fixed toolbar for easy access of gen search
** Carissa
*** Got it running
*** Created user testing survey (draft? changes possible)
*** <nowiki>https://goo.gl/forms/du9wpMsS8r2ol5zU2</nowiki>
** Will
*** Running
*** Got rid of redundant code and fixed some URL errors
* Discussion
** Heroku Website
*** Heroku website needs to be hosted from a non-personal Heroku account so the credentials can be shared with everyone and everyone can deploy to Heroku. Once that is done, everyone needs to set up remote pushing to Heroku.
*** We need to determine if we can connect to a local database from the hosted website. If we can't easily do that, then we will need the user to upload data as a csv, and the website will only have limited, static functionality. You will be able to search through generations, but you won't be able to get any features that rely on continuous updates, like updating pareto front.
** UI
*** Dashboard UI
**** The main visualization page and updating pareto front should be like tabs on a dashboard. We will get a template and use that.
**** We need navigation to the homepage and any other page.
*** Homepage UI
**** We could make this a lot nicer, especially since it's the first thing users see when they open the website
** Refactoring
*** We need to continue to refactor code and fix any points where we hardcoded going into localhost instead of the root website.
** EEG
*** We need to get the data from them to test our application on a different dataset
** User Testing
*** We will hold off on this for the time being until we make some core fixes

'''Research on Connecting Local DB to Hosted Website:'''

3 major options:
#Don't use a local database. Instead, export csv's for the "individuals" and "pareto front" tables from a local database. Then you can upload these csv files to our web application and it can give visualizations for everything, but they will be static. There won't be any continually updating visualizations.
# Try connecting a local database using the system's IP. There may be some loopholes to jump with this because of the natural security issues that this kind of access could lead to.
# Upload local database to a database hosting website. You can make continual updates to the database on the hosting website and EMADE-Viz can just connect to the hosted website.
What we will do:
# Set up csv uploading.
# Try the second option, if it doesn't work, implement the 3rd option.
# Then, we will be good to go!

== Week 4: January 28 - February 3, 2019 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Discussion:
** Viability of Heroku app
*** It seems like we are solving a problem that isn’t there
*** Heroku app was meant to be simpler
**** No simple way to connect local DB
**** A lot of code needs to be written to set up uploading a csv
*** Having user set up a local env to run EMADE-Viz is actually fairly easy
**** With a requirements file, it is very easy to locally set up Flask
* Todo’s
** Create a guide to setting up EMADE-Viz with a virtual environment - Anthony
** Meet to discuss testing with other teams - Anthony and Carissa
** Fix AUC graph - Michael
** Dashboard UI - Jeff and Will and Sierra
** Talk to Jason about hereditary visualizations - Will
** Visualization of # of pareto individuals over time - Suraj
** Make sure all code is merged - Everyone

'''User Study with Yash:'''
* Went really well!
* Notes are in our Google Drive
* Major takeaways
** We need to specify that EMADE-Viz runs completely seperately from EMADE
** Should just write out the specific command to create an environment from the yml file
** Extra packages in the requirements and environment file should be deleted
** We should add instructions related to creating the database with a csv or getting it from the person running the EMADE master instance
** Database connection instructions are really bad and need to be reworded
** Database connection success/failure have 0 feedback
* Task List
** Write a note at the top of EMADE-Viz that talks about how the application runs completely separately from EMADE
** Write out the commands to be run with Anaconda to create the environment
** Delete extra packages
** Add instructions about creating the database or getting it from the person running the EMADE master instance
** Revamp database connection instructions
** Redirect the user to dashboard on success of connecting to database
** Show red text 'Failed to connect to database' on failure of connecting to database

'''User Study with Animesh:'''
*Notes
**Progress Bar and Individuals List didn't seem to play an important purpose
**A little confused by the setup section, perhaps we don’t need it
***It mentions requirements.yml which is not actually there anymore
**The lack of feedback on logging in is confusing
*Misc.
** Stopped running and then reran EMADE
*** Seemed to have odd results to the database
*** This made it so that we couldn’t go past generation 15
** None of the first semester seem to pay attention to the scrums
** We should have two separate sections
'''User Study with Anish:'''
*Notes
** SSL Issue
*** There was an ssl issue when connecting for one of the guys, I believe it was his computer that was an issue
*** They had a similar problem when running emade and trying to connect to mysql
*** James had helped them figure it out but the fix didn’t make sense for how we are coding the connection, so I don’t know how to fix it
** A little confused about the layout of visualizations, some represent the whole EMADE process, some are just the current generation For more user study notes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A3axyGwJaDiJn8UyU_OiQC1Wf4EdHGMB6BEWksbTLOM/edit?usp=sharing

* Clearly, as of now, the increase in login time is not justified for the relatively marginal decrease in generation update time.
* We need to find other ways to decrease our load times
'''Determining Why the Pages Load Slowly'''

We should create a branch dedicated to optimizing the speed of page loading. We can test out one graph at a time and see what the load times are for the dashboard. That’ll let us know whether the bottleneck is certain graphs or the calls to the database.

Here is the [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zlmRR45vRG40iu5HKsqU_W2MrBFHMh5DDD1gEG_XOBk/edit?usp=sharing link] to our final presentation for the semester!

== Future Work ==
* Make EMADE log meta data in MySQL table
** Choose objectives for Pareto Front

* Finish Hierarchy Visualizations
* Add Seed Creation GUI
** Drag and drop nodes, creating a tree
** Export tree as string and upload to EMADE
* GUI for executing SQL Queries
* Removes the need to use MySQL Workbench separately
I believe that I deserve an A for my effort in the class. I worked throughout this semester in a project management capacity, conducted multiple [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1APrERAztV6XqcAb-qNXCwkD0pScepqANsdrtRTqtP9o/edit?usp=sharing user studies], worked on improving the user experience of our application, helped introduce the first-semester's to the project and get them up to speed, and settled most of the pull requests.
