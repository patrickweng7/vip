'''Team Meeting Notes'''

'''Sub-Team Notes'''

* Work on presentation slides
* Finish up baseline run on Chest x-ray
* Analyze results
* Talked with Anish about results with Chest x-ray Emade runs
** Found a paper that discusses x-ray results with various models
** Paper link: https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-65954/v1/52207f6d-bfed-4fa7-832e-3a9e3e0700c1.pdf
** Paper mentioned effectiveness of MobileNet and Inception V3
** We decided to test add Inception V3 to emade and test it, and it performed with high accuracy
** However, chest x-ray dataset is heavily skewed towards one label (many of the images have that disease)
** This causes many of the models to learn to just predict that one label

* New documentation fixes the old problems we were running into on PACE
* Old error was caused by running the line "import sep"
* This error was fixed by:
** module load gc
** export CC=gcc
** I believe these lines may have fixed the strange errors from before

'''Team Meeting Notes'''

'''Sub-Team Notes'''

* Localization is very expensive for Chest X-Ray
* For Chest X-Ray specifically, less than 1% of images are referenced in the bounded box csv file
* In addition to the sparseness of localized data, there are some other issues:
** Some of the disease labels are not even in the bounded box data
** The images are not easily classifiable because many of the diseases are not very localizable
* Looking at some of the ground truth data, it can be difficult to distinguish a disease with the human eye

* Look more into architectures that account for path dependence and shift invariance and include CRF layers and anti-aliasing filters
** See the following link: https://ml4health.github.io/2019/pdf/73_ml4h_preprint.pdf
* It is possible that YOLO is not the best architecture for this specific dataset, since localization is tricky
** Single stage detector such as YOLO and SSD sacrifice accuracy for speed

* This image shows a comparison between a healthy chest x ray (left) and one with Cardiomegaly (right)
* While we can clearly see a difference, it is also clear why this may cause some problems with classification, especially with bounded boxes
* To reiterate the above point, localization is tricky with chest x rays.
* With Cardiomegaly itself, it is hard to put a clear bounded box over the infected area.

|}

* Had to temporarily download all of the chest x ray images (~45gb)
** Needed to do this because bounded box csv file only labeled some of the images
** So I needed to write a script that found all of the images that are referenced in the bounded box csv file
* Once I had these images isolated, I split into train, test, and validation sets
* I used an image to text script to represent each image as a text file
** Detections in the image are represented as lines in the text files in the format: '''[label, normalized x, normalized y, normalized width, normalize height]'''
* I had to do this for every image in all of the image sets
* Next, I created a .names file that simply contains all of the disease labels line by line
* Additionally, I wrote scripts to handle other requirements
* I was able to train using another GitHub repository for 150 epochs
* The performance metrics from training can be seen below.

[[files/results.png|600px|Performance Metrics|center]]

* Example detection from testing can also be seen below.

[[files/00015425_012.png|600px|Example Detection|center]]

* Issues with bounded box approach:
** The bounded box csv only contains images for 8 of the 15 diseases
*** This could be because these are the only 8 diseases that can be pinpointed
** Though the model successfully trained for 150 epochs, the detection rate was horrible and it wasn't able to detect most diseases
** Perhaps more thorough training may be required, otherwise bounded box approach is not effective

== October 26, 2020 ==

'''Team Meeting Notes'''

* Get new members sorted out

'''Sub-Team Notes'''

* The bounded box csv file has individual diseases for each bounded box
** So I think I can train a yolo model to detect diseases in images using bounded boxes
** This would also allow the images to have multiple disease detections

* Used scp to move new yml file to pace
* Ran into issues with creating a new conda environment
** There was a disk quota exceeded issue
** .git folder inside emade was taking up too much space (used du -c command to see storage details)
** Can remove .git directory as long as you keep track of local changes for version control
** Removing git directory fixed disk quota issues
** Conda env create sill causing problems, though
*** Because of new path changes on pace, anaconda commands are not working
*** Fixed this by deleting and re-creating conda module on pace
** Still working on fixing conda problems

'''Sub-Team Notes'''

* I finally got PACE access
* Re-cloned the emade github repo into emade and switched to nn-vip branch
* Uploaded fraction of chest x-ray images into datasets file
** For this initial run, I just took 5000 images, instead of the whole dataset
** I created label csv files for my train and test folders, such that only the images in those folders are in the csv
** Image names are already compatible with emade load image format
* Edited xml file to be compatible with image data
* Updated mysql to create a new dataset with privileges
** ran into some issues with mysql (more details under action items)
* I performed a run on emade with the chest x ray data to confirm that it worked
* Next, I will seed individuals into the dataset before running

* The way to fix this error is to update the version of Deap
** Did this by cloning an updated, corrected version of deap from github
** Then, I used the scp command to move it from my local drive to Pace
** From here, I was able to pip uninstall deap and then reinstall the new version

* We had to experiment with several SQL commands to make sure emade works
* We found out that multiple people cannot run SQL at the same time on the same port
* Team members chose their own ports and added them to the .my.cnf file
* We also had to update the template xml files accordingly (with new port)
* I also ran into 'Access Denied' errors and other errors in relation to SQL
* The user 'root' on my computer did not have a password, which was a problem.
* To fix this, I had to follow these steps:
** I ran the command: FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
** I ran the command: UPDATE USER SET password=password('password') where USER='root';
** I then ran Flush Privileges again.
* These steps allowed me to get mysql properly running with access for the user root with password 'password'.
* We also decided to clear the database between emade runs to not pollute it too much.

* News dataset appeared to have an article title followed by the first sentence/line of the article
* Team is working on generating a seed for Emade based on the News dataset
* One problem with generating good results with the News dataset is:
** Since it currently takes the first line following the article title, it often takes the location
** It is nearly impossible to determine an accurate category to sort the article into using just a location

'''Team Meeting Notes'''

* Introduction to EMADE
** Discussion of how to install EMADE
** MySQL Connection Establishment
** Cross Folding and Monte Carlo trials
** Each train and test file create a DataPair object in emade
** Emade can run across multiple datasets
** Data is preprocessed into gzipped csv files
** Emade is an Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithm Design Engine
* Objectives
** The names will be used as columns in the database
** Weight specifies if it should be minimized (-1.0) or maximized (1.0)
** Evaluation Function specifies the name of a method
** Achievable and goal are used for steering the optimization, lower and upper are used for bounding
* Workers per Host specifies how many evaluations to run in parallel
* Evolution Parameters
** There are several parameters that control/affect the evolutionary process
** Parameters include initial population size, elite pool size, launch size, min queue size, outlier penalty, etc.
* Understanding EMADE Output
** The best place to look at the outputs of emade are is in the MySQL databases
** Use select and other SQL queries to access specific data
* EMADE Structure
** scr/GPFramework is the main body of code
** Contains actual evolutionary loop
** Primitive Set is built in gp_framework_helper.py
** Next week, we will talk more about the primitves and datapair objects

'''Sub-Team Notes'''

* Week Assignment
** Run EMADE as a group
*** 1 person should have the sql server set up and act as the master process, the rest should connect their workers
** Run for a substantial number of generations (like last assignment)
** Teach yourselves some SQL
** Make a plot of your non-dominated frontier at the end of the run, compare with ML and MOGP assignments
** Make any other plots and figures to show your analysis of EMADE running on the Titanic problem
*** See if you can find some successful trees
** Presentation on Monday the 21st

** Change primitives
** Change mutation/mating rates
** Change selection algorithms
*Task:
** Each person must come up with their own variation of the Titanic algorithm

'''Sub-Team Notes'''

* Every team member is tasked with creating a Titanic ML algorithm
* We modified the feature set of the model to make the algorithms more accurate
** We adjusted the values that some of the features map to through
** Combined sex and pclass into one value that numerically gives an advantage to women and upper class
** Each of us chose one of five algorithms we found to be codominant.

'''Team Meeting Notes'''

*Talked about Second Semester Teams
*What do we want from an algorithm?
**Space Efficiency, Time Efficiency
**Maximize True Positives, Minimize False Positives
**Security, precision of results, ease of usability, cost effectiveness, etc.
*Objective Space
**The evaluation of a genome associates a genome/individual with a set of scores
**Objectives are the set of measurements each genome is evaluated against
*Classification Measures
**Type I Error (False Positive)
**Type II Error (False Negative)
*Maximization Measures
**Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (hit rate)
**Specificity or True Negative Rate
*Minimization Measures
**False Negative Rate
**Fallout or False Positive Rate
*Other Measures
**Precision or Positive Predictive Value
***TP / (TP + FP)
**Negative Predictive Value
***TN / (TN + FN)
**False Discovery Rate
***FP / (TP + FP)
**Accuracy
***(TP + TN) / (P + N)

* Practice with Multi-Objective Genetic Programming and more Symbolic Regression
* The new evaluation function is slightly more complicated to ensure greater minimization of errors
* This time, we are minimizing the mean squared error and the size of the tree
* Pareto Dominance - outcome is beneficial to one without harming others
* Observed that, after running algorithm, tree size slowly increased and MSE slowly decreased over time
* Learned what Mu plus Lambda evolutionary algorithm is
