'''Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* We have decided on a team meeting every Wednesday at 5:45pm.  
* We discussed our goals as a team and after thinking of some ideas, we decided on the following action items:
** We will be each familiarizing ourselves with the EMADE codebase, how to start EMADE runs, different primitives, etc. 
** We will each read at least 1 research paper of interest related to an image processing problem to decide how we can begin this semesters research.
* We will be trying to find interesting papers which apply either GP approaches or traditional ML approaches to an image processing problem and recreate it in EMADE. We will be implementing new primitives and going off of the work that the NAS team did in their research paper last semester.
