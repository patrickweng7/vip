'''Subteam Meeting Notes:''' 
* Consideration from Jason: reprocess data to just have single label for train/test (if there are not too too many multi-label cases)
* To get vector out for checking the results of the objective function: dump out the numpy array inside the evaluation method, reinstall GPFramework, and then run individual with database or standalone tree evaluator script
* Food for thought for next semester: what about where in the image a disease is present, not just whether it exists or not (room for future work here! A bounding box for object detection!)

'''Midterm Presentation Notes:''' 
*NLP Team
**Trying to simulate the Bi-DAF model by first creating a word embedding and obtaining an output based on the context of the word
**Using the SQUAD dataset from Stanford with 100,000 answered and 50,000 unanswered questions.
**Trying to get close to the SOTA which is an F1 of 93.214
**They are also trying to get new evaluation metrics. For example, F1(new type), EM, MAP and MRR
**Haven’t completed all the primitives yet such as the output layer which is why they do not have any results yet.
**They are planning on using Facebook’s dataset. Dynamic/Episodic memory is the best as of now. 

*NAS:
**Hard for emade to outpace the seeded runs
**Long training times due to nesting
**Overall goal is to make EMADE competitive with VGG16 and other large structure architectures
**Objectives: 
***minimize accuracy errors and number of parameters
***Used time stopping of 600 vs 2500 seconds, latter ended in 1500 but generated less valid individuals and slightly better accuracy error (-0.05)
**Higher number of layers → higher num of error individuals (though 2-5 was less than baseline)
**Used only dense layers and convoluted layers
**Tracking layer frequencies across generations
**Created NNLearner table to track NNLearner individuals’ statistics

*Stocks (market and time series analysis):
**Objectives: use EMADE for regression on time series data and optimize market trading algorithm ; beat SOTA using EMADE
**They are trying to model papers and use technical indicators to predict price change points
**What are the best primitives to use: modelled TI’s versus the different regression techniques that are implemented
**Maximize profit percentage and average profit per transaction, minimize CDF of profit and variance of profit per transaction (four obj functions total)
**Best performance was with the least complex tree (only one TI)
**They are using minimization rather than maximization functions since they work better on EMADE.
**Having struggles with replicating the paper, primarily the fuzzy logic
**Hope to end the semester with a research paper

*Modularity:
**ARL: adaptive representation through learning
**ARL’s are implemented between the genetic operations and the evaluation phase
**Must be a complete tree
**It basically abstracts away complexity
**ARL’s should allow the population to converge faster
**Goal: allow search function to consider larger subtrees depth. Improve ARL candidate selection through a new weighting function (occurrences* ARL size / fitness of individual)
**Runs with both the old ARL’s and newer ARL’S are worse than with no ARL’s
**More data is needed to see effects of ARL complexity on performance
**Size != usefulness
**Using ARLs with Stocks
**Used various technical indicators
**Problems with Google Colab’s limited computing power and merging stocks’ codebase into the ARL codebase
**Individuals not evaluating because of cachev2 updates
**Study if selection during runs is biased
**Look into ARL construction (changes to hyperparameters, amount, etc.)
**More TI from stocks subteam

'''Subteam Meeting Notes:''' 
* We met on Wednesday to determine whether or not we could get pace to work on an EMADE run.
* Found out that many of the individuals with interesting primitives like the convolutional operator and LSTM were failing due to a mismatched data types i.e., changes have to be made to the primitives for working with image data. 
* Max showed us how to get the pace run done and make sure we're running on the shared conda environment.
* We also ended up meeting up on Sunday in order to get some more runs done. Me and Dhruv still struggled since the master worker was failing in a few minutes making the worker which was working till the walltime useless.
* In the end even the individuals which were evaluated through the valid pace run were limited due to primitives failing due to mismatched datatypes.

'''Team Meeting Notes:''' 
* Led the scrum session for our team this week since Max couldn't make it.
* Jason told us that it was the highest priority to get at least one emade run done to make sure that we had results to compare the CheXnet paper to and also make sure that we can test our new primitives because we can't showcase any results otherwise.

'''Subteam Meeting Notes:''' 
* Just completed my peer evaluations.
* Our objectives moving forward (for after fall break and before the presentations are due:
** Maxim gonna send his PACE setup so we can run EMADE on our pace-ice
** Aiming for end of fall break, getting runs working
** Monil working on testing some hyper features in EMADE, works locally and working with Heidi
** Dhruv/Harris are going to test NSGA3 (don’t need EMADE to make sure it works and will just use the StandAloneTree Evaluator)
** Will need actual EMADE run before mid-sem presentation to check improvement from baseline or not
** Aryaan/Temi looking at mating and crossover methods which will also need to be tested through multiple EMADE runs to check for improvement in individuals.
* I have not added a table here because the assignments are the same as the team meeting notes as October 4th.
== October 4th, 2021 == 
'''Team Meeting Notes:''' 
* I spoke to Temi separately since we are working together on the crossover functions. We will be implementing some of these crossover functions over the next week. These include different types of semantic and geometric crossover operators.
* I will also finish the peer evaluations before Friday this week.

* I completed the image preprocessing work and created a dataset of 5000 images from which 1000 were augmented appropriately.
* Here is the link to the python file with the code: https://github.gatech.edu/athite3/chestxray/blob/master/Preprocessing_Consolidated.py
* The preprocessing including the resize, augmentation and data prep for emade are all in this one file now and there's no need to be running multiple files to work with the data.

* Each of us discussed the progress that we had made till now. I had started the preprocessing work, gotten a dataset ready and also discussed some of the strategies for new crossover and mutation methods. 
* Max and I discussed image augmentation for data preprocessing at length and decided to use the Keras API i.e. image data generator for the purpose of augmenting the images. 
* Here are the augmentations that we will be implementing:
** Image resize and normalization
** Horizontal flipping, shear transforms
** Cropping, translations and rotations
* Here is Anish's existing repo of code which I will be building upon: https://github.gatech.edu/athite3/chestxray

'''Subteam Meeting Notes:''' 
* We discussed next steps for the image processing subteam and Jason also joined the meeting to discuss potential areas for improvement and next steps for the team as a whole. 
* We each had found one research paper do discuss and I found a couple which dealt with Autonomous Vehicles and image classification. In the end we agreed on working with the Chest X-ray dataset and improve upon a previous subteams work.
* Here are the overarching tasks for next week:
** Data preparation
*** Downsample (greyscale, lower resolution, balancing)
*** Talk to Anish
*** Try it out with EMADE as is
** Selection methods
*** NSGA3, Lexicase, etc.
*** Hypervolume indicator
*** Hyper-feature packaging
** Clever mating and mutation
*** Improve existing primitives
*** Semantic crossover
* I will be working with Maxim on the data pre-processing and also researching some interesting crossover and mutation strategies. 
* Max and I also spoke with Anish and here are the notes from our conversation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1755uB7JKe1NMVQIE-bMr6wpuaCp3niDnOX3k5_0ghMg/edit?usp=sharing

* Listened to all of the different subteams and their progress over the last 3 weeks. 
* We discussed next steps for the image processing subteam with Jason and he told us to make a decision regarding whether we are focussing on a classification or detection problem. 
* We each had found one research paper do discuss and I found one which was focused on object detection through masks.
* We decided that for Wednesday all of us should find one paper and dataset related to image classification to discuss during the Wednesday meeting so we can begin to work on replicating the results. 
* Jason will be joining our subteam meeting on Wednesday to assist us as well.

'''Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* We have decided on a team meeting every Wednesday at 5:45pm. I made the Google drive and took notes here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IRk4E5YBhr0adXikULUOvEEea6jgxWMw
* We discussed our goals as a team and after thinking of some ideas, we decided on the following action items:
** We will be each familiarizing ourselves with the EMADE codebase, how to start EMADE runs, different primitives, etc. 
** We will each read at least 1 research paper of interest related to an image processing problem to decide how we can begin this semesters research.
* We will be trying to find interesting papers which apply either GP approaches or traditional ML approaches to an image processing problem and recreate it in EMADE. We will be implementing new primitives and going off of the work that the NAS team did in their research paper last semester. 
* The research paper that I found was https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494604000316.
** The paper goes through a genetic approach to multi-object detection in an image
** In our subteam meeting I had mentioned image captioning but something we can try doing before that would be object detection. Single object or multi-object detection. Good datasets (possibly): MS COCO, with a variety of different objects

''' Team Meeting Notes: '''
* Maxim, Harris, and I met to discuss possible directions for the new image processing subteam and we discussed some of the research papers that Maxim had found. We thought that image registration might be an interesting direction and if not we could also look at some more basic image classification problems and think through the creation of better primitives. 
* Jason thought that image registration might not be the best strategy because of the lack of available data but we will be discussing more application for image processing later.

''' Team Meeting Notes: '''
* I initially attended this team meeting remotely since I wasn't yet on campus. I thought that both NAS and image processing with Auto ML were great subteams to join since I had significant past experiences with deep nets, especially with computer vision.
* Through the image processing slack I was able to meet up with Maxim and Harris to discuss some of the potential ways in which the new image processing subteam might work this semester.
* I initially thought that there could be many applications like image denoising, image enhancement, image registration and many of these kinds of processing fields within AutoML.
