* Can add code snippets to explain the data pair limitation fix.

=== General Meeting(11/30/20): ===
* Discussed our presentation briefly and did another dry run with the team.

=== Final Presentations(12/2/20): ===

==== Key takeaways from our presentations: ====
* Dr Rohling suggested that we look into linearly scaling and probability of finding ARL's in  our newly updated selection method in future semesters.
* Need to investigate why we aren't getting much statistical significance in our runs.
* Also need to have more runs for comprehensive analysis.
* Need to implement the 4 new changes suggested in the presentation.

==== Notes from other presentations: ====
* Stocks:
** Implemented multiple Technical indicator primitives including simple moving average, exponential moving average, moving average convergence and divergence, stochastic oscillator, relative strength indicator, Williams R%, Ease of movement, On Balance Volume, Bollinger Bands, CCI and MFI.
** Implemented one of the research papers and displayed analysis graphs for the same.
** Plan to use different time ranges and implement stuff other than the research paper.
* NN(Formerly NLP):
** Primarily used Chest X-ray and Wiki Detox dataset as a part of their runs. 
** Added new Computer Vision primitives, added new mutation functions, used the YOLO(You only Look Once) method for Chest Xray dataset.
** Want to test new datasets in the future.
* EzCGP:
** Used PACE for runs and had a lot of bugs. 
** Couldn't achieve much diversity but certain individuals performed extremely well.
** Used the CIFAR10 dataset and want to explore the MNIST dataset in the future.

=== Personal Contributions: ===
* This week I spent majority of the time running analysis scripts for our differential fitness runs and generating graphs for the same.
* In addition, I also added the introductory and the differential fitness slides to our final presentation(Slides 2-10).
* The image below depicts the analysis graphs for differential fitness. The one on the left shows comparison with the Baseline with No ARL's and the one on the right shows p-values over generations as a way to measure statistical significance.[[files/Analysis Graphs for Differential Fitness.png|center|thumb|582x582px]]

== Week 14:  November 16 2020-November 22 2020 ==

=== General Information: ===
* No sub team meeting during thanksgiving week. Rather we will have a presentation workday.
* Ask Dr Zutty and Dr Rohling about a final presentation dry run and get feedback.

=== Team Meeting Notes (11/16/20): ===
* Jacob is almost done setting up MNIST, used some of Ford's methods and plans to a run with it and include results in the presentation.
* The edge case fix for data pair limitation has been postponed for next semester. Gabe mentioned that it isn't hurting our results too much right now.
* Kevin is planning to merge his changes with Ruarai's changes and do a couple of runs with the same.
* Ivanna was able to do a couple of runs.
* First semester students will probably present future ideas during the final presentation.

=== SubTeam Meeting Notes (11/20/20): ===
* Gabe was able to get some analysis graphs for Data Pair Limitation experiment.(Mentioned in sub team wiki)
* Although we didn't get statistical significance in the data pair experiment, its still a good change as many of the ARL's were learners.
* We won't be meeting next week because of thanksgiving break, so we should plan to finish runs soon and upload their SQL dumps to the drive.
* Jacob is finished merging MNIST into EMADE and plans to do a sample run over the weekend.

* Early analysis of Selection method shows little improvement when comparing with baseline that to in certain generations. We don't see much statistical significance either.
* Gabe also mentioned about certain edge cases related to data pair limitation  that need to be fixed .

=== SubTeam Meeting Notes (11/13/20): ===
* Short meeting
* Gabe is till having issues fixing the edge case related to data pair limitation.
* Some team members are still having issues with runs taking longer; this might be because of more valid individuals.
* Gabe also suggested that all team members focus on one run at a time rather than splitting into groups.

* Presentation Link:  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZTS5ij1kNA8cymFyIYWU1fkuJe3PuNVl_H2IyzB22RQ/edit?usp=sharing

* Key Takeaways/ Comments on our presentation:
** Data from more runs could have been better; the current one is very trivial and inaccurate.
** Introductory stuff could have had one slide explaining how a set of primitives transform into an ARL.
** Future work and MNIST data set looks nice.
* Notes on other presentations:
** '''Stocks/Portfolio Optimization:''' Spent a lot of time setting up the basic codebase. Have used the CEFLANN network; Used the S&P 500 as their base initially.For some reason their model didn't report a profit, so need to improve that.
** '''NLP''': Used the Chest X-Ray dataset; renaming to Neural Network! Looked into adaptive mutation functions. Want to test layer addition and use their model on other datasets.
** '''EzCGP:''' Used CIPHAR dataset. Used DAG's and custom primitive. Examining the relationship between convergence and runtime.

=== Subteam Meeting Notes(10/23/20): ===
* Short meeting. No one had any updates so just discussed future tasking.
* Current priority should be to get as many runs as possible.
* Make a presentation for new members.

=== SubTeam Meeting Notes (10/2/20): ===
Short Meeting:
* Ruarai is close to finishing up his heuristic.
* I started a run on Collab but it required refreshing after every ~1.5 hours, so Gabe suggested to implement an autoclicker for overnight runs.
* Kevin finished his heuristic but is having issues with PACE; since PACE is taking longer than expected we are going to tackle this sometime later in the semester.
* Gabe mentioned that the bugs in diff fitness are some local server issues and it should run fine on Colab..
* Midterm presentations are coming up so we should prioritize runs of our implemented heuristics followed by analysis.
* Tasking for next week:
** Run Diff fitness to ensure its bug free.
** Implement the auto clicker for long colab runs.

=== Personal Contributions: ===

* Literature Review:
** Read an article titled "Functional Modularity for Genetic Programming".
** Link: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1569901.1570037
** '''Summary''': The main idea is to examine the semantics along with syntax of our modular structure. This is done using a parameter called monotonicity which essentially measures correlation of a potential subgoal’s difference from module’s semantics and the fitness of the modular solution.
*** The experimentation/computation involves 3 things:
***# Calculating differences in monotonicity between subgoals.
***# Calculating differences in monotonicity between problems.
***# Estimating monotonicity from evolution.
*** It then uses the results from above computations to use monotonicity to find the optimal solution
*** Results:
**** Monotonicity varies within the problem and between various problems.
**** Monotonicity can be reliably estimated from an evolutionary run
**** For some problems, the monotonicity of solution’s closest subgoal highly correlates with its fitness.
** '''Conclusion/Usefulness''': Exploitation of monotonicity '''might be''' one of the ways to enhance modularity.
* Potential Future Readings:
** https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2330163.2330276 -> "Tag based modularity in tree based genetic programming"

== Week 6: September 21 2020 - September 27 2020 ==

=== General Information: ===
* Colab is finally running!

=== Team Meeting Notes (9/21/20): ===
* Members from the EzCGP team were also having trouble with database creation using port forwarding when setting up EMADE on Colab.
** Suggested that we instead use a custom AWS RDS Database and link it with Colab.

=== SubTeam Meeting Notes (9/25/20): ===
* Kevin implemented a new selection method in the new_selection branch.
* Jacob and I are still having issues with port forwarding; we are gonna work with Gabe on Saturday to fix this using some sort of AWS database.(Fixed)
* Kevin is having some sort of accessibility and other issues with PACE.
* Reginna was having issues with her GT account when setting up .
* Need to run 10-20 gens of diff_fitness_norefactor branch to ensure the bugs are local and its bug free in general.

=== Subteam Short Meeting(9/26): ===
* Finally Google Colab is up and running:
** We created an AWS RDS Db as suggested in the main meeting.
** Notebook Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i_niAH2dxqdsdA-SMU3tYXCOW0DMRUXK?usp=sharing

=== Team Meeting Notes (9/14/20): ===
* Discussed rubric for notebook evaluation; need to complete self evaluation.
* Discussed results of selection method trials with Jason; we get a statistical significance in early generations using our modified selection method.
* Discussed potential improvements to tournament selection and better ways to pick ARL's with Jason.

=== SubTeam Meeting Notes (9/18/20): ===
* Short meeting; Jacob is having the same SQL Database issue with setting up collab.
* Ruarai added some small changes to the selection method.
* Gabe thought the differential fitness was bug free, but still having issues when running it. It's probably something around cluster dependency.
* Reginna is done setting up EMADE on her local computer and is now following through the documentation for setting up EMADE on collab.
* Next step should be to run differential fitness branch on google collab/PACE once we are done setting up.

*** Read an article titled "Constraining connectivity to encourage modularity in HyperNEAT".
*** Link: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2001576.2001776
*** '''Summary:''' This paper primarily examines how we can introduce modularity along with regularity in Neural networks; in particular "this paper provides an important clue to how an indirect encoding of network structure can be encouraged to evolve modularity."
*** '''Results:'''
**** By modifying HyperNEAT in a particular way such that connectivity is independent of the pattern of weights, we can make modularity and regularity independent of each other and hence encourage modularity in neural networks.
**** This would require seeding the evolution with locality.
*** Couldn't find something that we would implement, but might be useful later if we collaborate with the NLP team since they are working on Neural Networks.

=== Personal Contributions: ===
* Local Selection method run is still taking longer than expected; after around 12 hours it was on gen 25 which is somewhat strange.
* Tried fixing the differential fitness issue, but having some problem as the branch happens to have multiple bugs. Link: https://github.gatech.edu/gwang340/emade/tree/feature/DifferentialFitness_NoRefactor
* Literature Review:
** Read an article titled "Exploiting the Relationship Between Structural Modularity and Sparsity for Faster Network Evolution".
** Link: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2739482.2768472
** '''Summary''': The main idea is that a network is essentially modular if its split into multiple networks such that each network has tight connections within itself but the networks have weak connections with each other.This article shows that seeding with a sparse network increases modularity. However, starting the evolution with a sparse network poses the challenge of decreased modulartiy over time.
*** The experiment  mainly uses 3 main performance evaluators:
***# Performance: Minimization function of fitness.
***# Connection Cost: Minimization of total number of connections
***# Time Since Mutation: Minimization of time since last mutation in the network.
*** In addition, the experiment uses two objectives: an evolutionary algorithm and a mutation operator.
** '''Conclusion''': "Seeding with a population of randomly generated sparse networks can facilitate the evolution of modularity and increase the rate of adaptation."

= Spring 2020: =

== Week 16: April 20 2020- April 24 2020 ==

=== General Information: ===
* Presentations on 4/20 from 4:30pm-7:30pm via BlueJeans.
* Notebooks due on 4/27 by 5:20pm; peer evals due on 4/22.

=== ADF Final Presentation(4/20/20): ===
Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pM_VSVOVw0l5aHGx5YjvkpRcBvNPixVkjcpAnIzLzPk/edit?usp=sharing
* Reviews and Comments:
** Overall nice presentation focused on analysis with a lot of visualizations.
** We should incorporate the results from our 5th differential fitness run.(Slide 30 needs changes)
** Its good to explain why a particular ADF is the "best".
** It would have been good if we could have included some more code and infrastructure changes.
** The p-value table at then end was a good pick for the presentation.

=== Takeaways from Other Presentations: ===
* '''Research Fundamentals''': Achieved statistical significance on hypervolume; Were able to get results from PACE in about 8 hours; Were having issues with git-lfs
* '''NLP''': Implemented activation functions like ELU,ReLu SeLu etc; implemented a multiple category labeling framework; glove Encoding vector differences
* '''NLP Time Conflict''': Implemented algorithms like TFIFS; having issues with PACE throughout the semester.
* '''EzCGP''': Using the CIPHAR data set consisting of about 60,000 images; new semester students ezCGP 1.0 on PACE; used algorithms like VGG-16, 3 Block VGG,LeNet-5, ParneetK CNN etc; fixed data augmentation this semester; GPU was significantly faster than CPU.

=== Future Work: ===
* Naming conventions.
* More Runs for comprehensive statistical analysis.
* More heuristics for better ADF selection.
* More mating/mutation functions for better results/ statistical significance.
* Use a more complex dataset than Titanic.

=== Conclusion: ===
* We are really happy we were able to implement all heuristics and analyze it to a fair extent.
* We were able to, atleast partially, fulfill this semester's goal of extreme statistical analysis.

== Week 15: April 13 2020- April 19 2020 ==

=== General Information: ===
* Presentations on 4/20.
* Notebooks will most likely be collected on 4/27.
* Peer Evals due on 4/22. I need to evaluate everyone on the ADF team and not just the members in my subteam.
* Presentation dry run with Greg on Sunday.(Timing TBD)

=== Team Meeting Notes (4/13/20): ===
* Scrum Notes:
** Differential Fitness heuristic is almost complete; the only thing left is assignment of a variable that takes the data from the database and computes the differential fitness. We can start having local runs tomorrow and ask Jason to spin up the GCP cluster. Right now, our aim is to have around 4-5 runs.
** Primitive Analysis subteam has all the required data about the general population and the ADF population. We need to visualize all the information and then try to draw inferences from it. We should also try to incorporate the data from the diff fitness and selection method runs.
** Selection Method subteam has been working on the size metric but it looks like they are going slightly in the wrong direction.
** Goals: Have the heuristics implemented by Tuesday and so that we can have about 4-5 runs by Friday and  start on the presentation.

=== Differential Fitness Subteam Meeting: (4/16/20): ===
* Aaron fixed the issue with parental tracking and mating pool.
* We are done with 3 runs and expect to report 5 in the presentation.
* Most of the time was spent making the presentation.
* We aim to put some visualizations of primitive distribution using diff fitness heuristics and compare it with intelligent ADF's because the diff fitness heuristic was branched off of that.

=== Primitive Analysis Subteam Meeting: (4/17/20): ===
* Gathered the data that maps primitive counts to their frequency in the ADF population.
* Visualized the top 15 primitives by frequency in every run.
* I got the following results:
[[files/Primitive Distribution in Frequency based ADF's.png|left|thumb|317x317px]]
[[files/Primitive Distribution in Selection Methods based ADF's.png|center|thumb]]
[[files/Primitive Distribution in Differential Fitness based ADF's.png|left|thumb|322x322px]]
[[files/Intelligent ADF's Primitive Distribution.png|center|thumb|295x295px]]

* As per our expectations, we note that our newer heuristics are clearly more 'picky', and hence select fewer number of ADF's as desired.

=== Presentation Review(4/19/20) ===
* Suggestions:
** Add date on the front page.
** Make the primitive analysis graph horizontal and normalize it for better comparisons.
** Label each visualization in the presentation.
** In general, try to state more inferences drawn form the analysis and visualizations.
** In addition, for better comparisons try to put two curves on the same graph with different colors.
** Add one reference to the last page and try to incorporate data from another diff fitness run.
* Reviews:
** Nice presentation with a lot of analysis and visualizations; better if we include more inferences drawn from visualizations.

* Discussed what success looks like at the end of the semester with Greg and Jason.
* Discussed about future infrastructure changes and the direction for further statistical analysis.

=== Differential Fitness Subteam Meeting: (4/2/20): ===
* For implementing the differential fitness heuristic the following infrastructure changes need to be made:
*# A dictionary that keeps a track of all the parents of an individual and stores it in the database.
*# A way to query the database and retrieve an individual's parents.
*# A function that subtracts an individual's fitness from its best parent's fitness and stores it as the differential fitness.

=== Primitive Analysis Subteam Meeting: (4/3/20): ===
* Having Technical Difficulties with BlueJeans, used WebEx instead
* Went over the parsing script with the first semesters and explained the type of data we expect to have (primitive distribution over the population and in the ADF's).
* Brainstormed about potential metrics about what makes a good adf?
* We expect to have the data of primitive distribution over the population and ADF's by Friday.
* Potential Metrics(Brainstorm more on these):
** Fitness
** Frequency
** False Positive and False Negative Rates

== Week 1: January 6 2020- January 10 2020 ==

=== General Information: ===
* Continue with Team ADF
* Time Conflict with main meeting.
* Conflict Section: Friday 4pm. Klaus 1440(1/24/20 onwards)
* Slack still the main source of communication, but Piazza can also be utilized.

* Sub team Wiki Link: 

=== Team Meeting Notes (1/6/20): ===
* Statistical Analysis of Hypothesis testing:
** Since EMADE is based on random processes, we need to have a way to measure the accuracy of our changes
*** Proof of making changes
*** Are the improvements due to our changes or randomness?
* t-Statistics test:
** '''t=(x  - μ_0) / (s / √n)''' , where t is t statistic, x is mean, s is standard deviation and n is number of samples
** The t-statistic tells us notionally how far we are from the mean by steps of estimated standard deviation.
** t-statistic can also be computed using a t-table.
** This t statistic can help us calculate p-value.
* p-value gives a probability of getting a standard deviation from the mean for a certain number of samples.
** sci-py library can be used to calculate p-value from the t-statistic
* Welch's t-test allows us to calculate p-value without mean and standard deviation.
* Designing Experiments:
** If we want strong results, we wither need differences in sample means that overwhelm the sample variance, or a high number of samples to reduce the effect of the variance.
** If we have an idea of the type of change we expect to see, we can compute a number of trials and we should need to prove it

=== Sub team Meeting Notes(1/9/20): ===
'''Goals:'''
* Use Viz's code to get the following metrics from our schemas

* Metrics:
** Compute time (Caching)
** Average AUC
** AUC Slope (regression with single variable)
** Generations to critical value

* Be able to calculate the P value of an experiment, and the critical value for our Alpha value in a script.

Introduction to Genetic Programming
<ul>
<li>Trees are used to represent programs in GP.
<li>Genetic programming has single point crossovers which is performed by simply swapping subtrees.
<li>The prime difference between weakly typed and strongly typed GP is that  weakly type can have broader class of primitives and strongly typed GP is a restriction for a type to allow data.
