'''VIP Meeting Notes:'''
* Lecture 2: Genetic Programming
** Same as Genetic Algorithms except Mating and Mutation are different due to change in representation of genome of individuals
** Uses graphs: tree structure
** Nodes --Primitives (+,-,*,%)
** Leaves - Terminals
** Instead of evaluating genome, the genome tree itself is the function/evaluation
** Mutations, many ways to mutate individuals: change primitive function of a node, randomly generate a tree and insert it into the genome tree, delete a tree and move its children up etc.
* DEAP
** Primitive function set
** Arity: number of inputs to a primitive function in the Primitive function set
* Symbolic Regression
** y = sin(x)
** Primitive set: +, -, *, /, !, exp (exponents)
** Terminals: x, constants

'''VIP Meeting Notes:'''
* Lecture 3: Multiple Objectives
** Gene Pool: set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation\
*** Genome: Genotypic description of an individual analogous to DNA
*** Search Space: set of all possible genomes (Important to consider as it may affect how many generations we should run for and whether we need to add more primitives
** Evaluation: A function that takes in an individual (as a set of parameters in GA or a string in GP) and maps each individual to a set of scores based on objectives we want to maximize or minimize
*** Some examples of these scores include True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP)
*** Objectives: The set of measurements against which each individual is scored against
*** Phenotype
** Objective Space: Set of objectives
** Evaluation is essentially a function from the Search Space to the Objective Space (the phenotype description of each genome in the search space
** Classification Measures: Confusion Matrix
** Maximization Measures:
*** Sensitivity/True Positive Rate (TPR): TPR = TP/P = TP/(TP + FN)
**** Also known as hit rate or recall
*** Specificity (SPC) or True Negative Rate (TNR): TNR = TN/N = TN/(TN + FP)
** Minimization Measures:
*** False Negative Rate (FNR): FNR = FN/P = FN/(TP + FN) = 1 - TPR
*** Fallout or False Positive Rate (FPR): FPR = FP/N = FP/(TN + FP) = 1 - TNR
** Other Measures:
*** (Want to maximize) Precision of Positive Predictive Value (PPV): PPV = TP/(TP + FP)
*** (Want to minimize) False Discovery Rate (FDR): FDR = FP/(TP + FP) = 1 - PPV
*** (Want to maximize) Negative Predictive Value (NPV): NPV = TN/(TN + FN)
*** (Want to maximize) Accuracy (ACC): ACC = (TP + TN)/(P + N) = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)
** Fitness Computation
*** Objective Space: Each individual is evaluated using objective functions including mean squared error, cost, complexity, TPR, TNR etc.
*** The Objective score calculated for each individual can be used to map each individual to a point in the Objective Space (Phenotype of the individual)
** Pareto Optimality:
*** An individual is Pareto if there is no other individual that outperforms it in '''all''' objectives
*** The set of Pareto individuals forms the Pareto Frontier
*** Selection favors Pareto individuals but is able to maintain diversity by giving all individuals some chance of mating
** Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA ||)
*** Population separated into non-domination ranks where the lower ranked non-domination frontier individuals dominate all individuals in higher ranked frontiers
*** Individuals Selected using binary tournament
*** Ties on any given front are broken using crowding distance
**** Crowding Distance: Summation of normalized Euclidean distances to all points within the front
**** The higher crowding distance individual wins the tie
** Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)
*** Each Individual possesses a strength ''S'': the number of individuals in the population the given individual dominates
*** Each Individual possess a rank ''R'': R is the sum of the ''strength'' ''S'' 's of the individuals that dominate the given individual
*** The distance to the k<sup>th</sup> nearest neighboring individual (σ<sup>k</sup>) is calculated to obtain fitness: R + 1/ (σ<sup>k</sup> + 2)

Titanic ML presentation notes:

Every group had their own unique way of cleaning data

NSGAII due to lots of crowding

Different crossover and mutation rates didn't change much

ML vs GP:

ML: 3

GP: 2
