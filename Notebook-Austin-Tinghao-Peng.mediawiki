* genetic algorithms lecture
* introduction to Jupyter notebook and lab 1
=== Lecture Notes ===
* The concept of genetic algorithms is that each new generation of algorithms is created through the mating or mutation of individuals in the previous population. Through manny iterations of this process, it produces the best individual.
* Mating or crossover is the creation of a new algorithm using a specified number of parts of the previous algorithm depending on the number of split points.
* A mutation introduces random modifications to the algorithm in order to help maintain diversity.
* A simple genetic algorithm problem is the One Max problem which essentially wants to produce a list of all 1's given a list of binary numbers.
