=== CacheV2 Merge Instructions === 
Diff: https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/compare/CacheV2...vhuang31:ARL_Update
All do 15-20 files. Indicate files changed in commit messages.
* Clone this fork of emade. git clone https://github.gatech.edu/bbal3/emade We’ll be working off of the branch CacheV2_ARL
* The goal is to move all the changes from adfs into the most recent version of CacheV2, which is merged over into our branch CacheV2_ARL . * Here are all the file changes we need to make: https://github.gatech.edu/gwang340/emade/compare/ARL_Update...emade:CacheV2
* NOTE: the above link shows the comparison between our branch with the extended ARL changes and CacheV2. Note how the arrow is pointing, this means we’re adding all the file changes we did in our fork with adfs into the main repository, using the cachev2 branch
=== Subteam Meeting: Nov. 11 ===
* Vincent has done more runs 
=== Time Conflict Meeting: Nov. 12 ===
* Test changes for cachev2 merge by running the EMADE script, looking at testing files.

== '''Week 11:''' Oct. 31 - Nov. 6 ==
=== Subteam Meeting: Nov. 4 ===
* New team members, introduced them to:
** Modularity Wiki https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/wiki/Modularity, Meeting Times, tasking to set up with Google Colab 
* How to get onto Google Colab (Vincent)
How to get on google collab:
Clone the repo https://github.gatech.edu/vhuang31/emade/tree/master
If the CloudCopy.sh does not exist in the main directory, go ahead and make it by copying this file here https://github.gatech.edu/vhuang31/emade/blob/ARL_Update/CloudCopy.sh
If you cannot run CloudCopy.sh (it says something about permission denied), then run chmod +x CloudCopy.sh
This should create a emade-cloud directory. Upload that directory onto google drive and call it whatever the branch you're working on is (eg, emade-extended-arl) Note that you can call it whatever you want, just make sure to call it something so that you can tell which version of EMADE it is.
In google drive (or alternatively, you can do this before uploading the files to google drive), open up emade-cloud (or whatever you renamed the folder to) and navigate to templates
Open input_titanicADFON.xml in a text editor
Near the top of the file, there should be a dbConfig similar to this one. Edit it to match the following details, with the database renamed to the schema name the run you're trying to join is
<dbConfig>
        <server>database-2.ch6igrzmr2yu.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com</server>
        <username>admin</username>
        <password>mypassword</password>
        <database>INSERT_SCHEMA_NAME_HERE</database>
        <reuse>1</reuse>
    </dbConfig>
You'll also want to change the following line to have a max arl size of 10
        <maxAdfSize>10</maxAdfSize>
8.  In google drive, make a copy of this Google Collab Notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tUqnDzLHNg7RoYc4sarB3e2k3BvR_7D7?usp=sharing
9. In the notebook, edit the second step %cd /content/gdrive/MyDrive/INSERT-DIRECTORY-NAME-HERE/ to be whatever you renamed your directory in google drive to
10. Run all of the commands in the notebook sequentially except for the !python src/GPFramework/seeding_from_file.py [input xml template] [seeding file] command. This seeds the run with individuals, which only needs to be done once by the master process
11. Make sure that the !python src/GPFramework/launchEMADE.py -w templates/INSERT-TEMPLATE-FILE-NAME command has the -w flag. Otherwise, you will join as a master process which could cause problems.
12. Once the final command has been run, wait ~10 minutes and check the directory in google collab. You should see a new worker####.err and worker#####.out file. Check the worker#####.out file and note its progress. Wait another ~10 minutes and open the worker####.out file again. If nothing new has been written to the file, EMADE is probably not working and something has gone wrong. Otherwise you should be good to go! Alternatively, you could use mysqlWorkbench to check the status of the run. 
=== Time Conflict Meeting: Nov. 5 ===
* Talked about new members and tasking
* Help with CacheV2
** Fork off of CacheV2 and look at diff, compare to Vincent's fork off of ARL_Update

* Note: Fall Break Oct. 11-12 / Sick
=== Subteam Meeting: Oct. 14 ===
* Tried to get into PACE-ICE with team.
* Discussed presentations for midterm. 
=== XUFEI’S WAY OF RUNNING EMADE ===
*After getting emade set up:
**ssh into pace-ice and allocate a node/start the database. I found that I can start the database by just running mysqld_safe and NOT cd /usr
** conda activate emade (name of the environment)
** Create a database in a new terminal after ssh’ing onto the atl-… address with command CREATE DATABASE <name>;
** Later, you can also delete a database if you type DROP DATABASE <name>;
** exit mysql and find the template file. Then use vim input_titanic or something similar to edit
** When editing, the server is the atl… address, the hostname/password are your information, and the database is the name you used when creating the database in the past
** Unfortunately, running into errors when actually running emade using the following commands:
*** python src/GPFramework/launchEMADE.py templates/<input_file>
*** Make sure you use launchEMADE.py and not launchGTMOEP.py as our codebase is just a little different

=== SICK / Time Conflict Meeting: Oct. 15 ===
Updates from Xufei:
* Hackathon on Saturday 
* Need to use code from new EMADE branch to not get error

'''Self Work'''
* WAS ABLE TO DEBUG ISSUE WITH PACE-ICE (not being able to get into <code>mysql</code>)
** Small modification of Gabe's instructions from last week: 
** I got PACE-ICE working--and instead of ssh’ing back into <code>ssh atl1-1-02-012-5-l # whatever name</code> I exited back into the login node (ran <code>exit</code> after running <code>qsub -I -q pace-ice -l nodes=1:ppn=1,walltime=01:00:00</code>) and was able to run <code>mysql -u root</code> from there and follow the rest of the EMADE instructions 
=== Subteam Meeting: Oct. 7 ===
* Met new member, Diptendu! Part of disbanded Stocks team
* Goal to get runs over fall break
* Tried to debug PACE-ICE issues with team. 

=== AAD Time Conflict Meeting: Oct. 8 ===
'''Missed Class Updates''': 
* Hackathon Oct. 16
* Youssef and Diptendu to join our team
'''Modularity Updates''':
* Debugged issues with setting up conda environment and setting up packages with EMADE
** My Fix: <code>activate conda env_name</code> ... easy fix 
* dataset of stocks is your target, so the paper is going to cover:
** general background on what arls are, emade, automated ml
** methodology - how did you implement the arl process, pseudocode, block diagrams, actual code, how you make arls in the evolutionary process, what is the pool you're selecting from
*** 3.1 - how are they constructed and how are they used
* analysis auc over time with different objectives, what types of individuals are being found, general conclusions at end with how arls are working with emade
* selections are being biased towards arls with them - rory
** baseline framework, experimentation, hypothesis, what could show promise
** are there targeted mutations that might help, are there selection methods that help, what could we do to tweak
* really need a strong positive result, hard to prove otherwise

* 
'''Self Work''':
* Paper: https://www.overleaf.com/1338174365qrqxskrvkfyj
* Debugging with PACE-ICE using Gabe's method in chat:
After the db is started, request a new job using <code>qsub -I -q pace-ice -l nodes=1:ppn=1,walltime=01:00:00</code> (doesn't matter if the node is the same)
Type <code>exit</code> to get back to the login node, then <code>ssh atl1-1-02-012-5-l # whatever name</code>
Once you're in the node, type <code>mysql -u root</code>
Then run the following sql queries:
<code>DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'USERNAME'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</code>
Check this works, by exit then <code>mysql -u USERNAME</code> to make sure you can login as your new user
Then follow the rest of the steps in the guide and it will hopefully work
** Still not working, having authentication issue when running <code>ssh</code>

** Try to change hyperparameters? amount used, how they're built, ranking criteria
* Could also write a paper like the stocks team

'''Currently in the time conflict section. Fridays 3-4PM'''
=== AAD Time Conflict Meeting: Aug 27 ===
* We're possibly considering merging with the stocks subteam who is also in the time conflict section. 
* Possible Research Ideas:
** Stocks team has found that some trees are being reused. Could be interesting to test their dataset with our code.
** Adding complexity (implementing new primitives, evaluation functions)
** Changing how to store primitives in the database (downside of how arls are created is that some of the data can no longer be accessed as it's condensed) 
** Baseline runs
