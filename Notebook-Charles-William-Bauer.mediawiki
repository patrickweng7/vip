===Lab 1: DEAP===

===Walkthrough: Genetic Algorithms===

===Bootcamp Notes: Genetic Algorithms===
#Randomly initialize population
#Determine fitness using objective
#Repeat i-iv until the best individual is good enough
##Select parents from population (fitness proportionate or tournament)
##Perform Mate/Crossover – choose a point (or multiple) to switch lists after
##Perform Mutation – random modifications of values to maintain diversity
##Determine fitness of population

When? Search space is very large, discontinuous, non-linear, local extrema dense
