===Bootcamp Notes: Genetic Algorithms===
Genetic algorithms
1. Randomly initialize population
2. Determine fitness using objective
3. Repeat a-d until the best individual is good enough
    a. Select parents from population (fitness proportionate or tournament)
    b. Perform Mate/Crossover – choose a point (or multiple) to switch lists after
    c. Perform Mutation – random modifications of values to maintain diversity
    d. Determine fitness of population
When? Search space is very large, discontinuous, non-linear, local extrema dense
