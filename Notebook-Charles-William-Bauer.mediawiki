===Lab 1: Genetic Algorithm Problems===
One Max Problem: The algorithm tried to make the max-fitness individual all 1s in 40 generations using tournament selection, crossover, and mutation. The population had 300 individuals of 100 Boolean numbers each. The tournament size was 3, crossover probability 0.5, mutation (random new 0 or 1) probability 0.2.

N Queens Problem: The algorithm found how to position n queens on an nxn board so that none could take each other. The algorithm minimized the number of diagonal conflicts and reached a stable bend in the minimum (and average) in around 25 generations.


===Walkthrough: DEAP===
The walkthrough demonstrated how to use base, creator, and tools to create a population of two individuals with one hundred Bernoullis.

===Bootcamp Notes: Genetic Algorithms===
#Randomly initialize population
#Determine fitness using objective
#Repeat i-iv until the best individual is good enough
##Select parents from population (fitness proportionate or tournament)
##Perform Mate/Crossover – choose a point (or multiple) to switch lists after
##Perform Mutation – random modifications of values to maintain diversity
##Determine fitness of population

When? Search space is very large, discontinuous, non-linear, local extrema dense
