=== <u>Team Meeting Notes</u> ===
Monday:
* Make notebook entries more detailed moving forward
* Include code, graphs, links, etc
* Include things at a level that it could be reproduced by someone else
Friday (Sub-Team Meeting):

<u>Amazon Reviews Dataset</u>
* Preprocessing is complete
* Steven attempted to run EMADE on the dataset and faced some version issues
** Likely will not be able to get any iterations before 
* Preprocessing file does not account for non-UTF-8 characters
** This will also be addressed next semester most likely

== November 16th, 2020 ==

=== <u>Team Meeting Notes</u> ===
Monday:
* We are able to use PACE which should help with increasing the amount of iterations we can do with EMADE
* Meeting set for Thursday to collaborate virtually with subteam

* Continuing to preprocess the dataset and writing the XML file necessary for EMADE
Thursday:
* Running into a problem with Amazon dataset with processing characters in the reviews that are not UTF-8
** Often occurs in reviews written in Spanish
* Options to solve this problem are:
** Go through all the characters and simply ignore the characters that are not UTF-8
** Find a workaround to translate Spanish characters into English approximations or equivalents
*** This is the preferred option as it will increase readability and comprehension levels
Friday:
* Continuing to set up PACE
* We were told the run Ice Hammer if we have the option
* Continue to address the problems we ran into on Thursday, try to have it done by Monday so it can be ready for the presentation

=== <u>Lecture Notes</u> ===
* Presentation Day: All groups presented on what they worked on
* Notes on Subteams:
* Stocks (Market Analysis and Optimization)
** Goal: to optimize stock trading methods.
** Used Genetic Programming, and researched current Machine Learning Techniques to combine to run the problem.
** They ran EMADE with Regression and Collab.
** Results: had values that gained money, but fell short of the results of the research paper they emulated
* Modularity
** Exploring ways to abstract parts of individuals
** Currently working on Refactoring ARL Arguments, limiting what ARL's could be created, and experimenting with new selection methods
** Also tried Handwritten Digits, which would likely make more ARL's
* Natural Language Processing
** Goal: Apply evolutionary approach to neural architecture search using EMADE.
** Base on the research paper: "Evolutionary Neural AutoML for Deep Learning"
** Learner had embedding layers and output layers.
** Potential Next Step would be to add more Primitives.
* EZGCP
** Graph based structure instead of tree based

=== <u>Class Notes:</u> ===
* Assigned to a subteam to complete analysis of Titanic data from Kaggle
* Group subteam: Youssef Elmougy, Steven Leone, Weiyao Tang, Christopher Ozgo
* Group tasked with using different classifiers to create a Pareto frontier on which all our different classifiers are co-dominant for the confusion matrix.

=== <u>Subteam Meeting Notes (September 14th):</u> ===
* Team met to analyze results from different classifiers
* My confusion matrix was:  
*  Confusion Matrix [[163  11] [35  59]]
which fell along the Pareto frontier
* Used neural_networks classifier to achieve an accuracy of 0.828
* All classifiers were unique and co-dominant, thus achieving desired result

=== <u>Notebook Assessment:</u> ===
* I reviewed my Notebook this week, with my evaluation given below:

=== <u>Team Meeting Notes</u> ===
* '''Multiple Objectives:'''
** Gene pool is the set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation
** The evaluation of a Genome associates a genome/individual with a set of scores:
*** True Positive (TP)
*** False Positive (FP)
*** True Negative (TN)
*** False Negative (FN)
** This creates a confusion matrix: {| class="wikitable" | |'''Predicted Positive''' |'''Predicted Negative''' |- |'''Actual Positive''' |True Positive (TP) |False Negative (FN) <small>Type II Error</small> |- |'''Actual Negative''' |False Positive (FP) <small>Type I Error</small> |True Negative (TN) |}
** '''Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR):''' TP/P = TP/(TP+FN)
** '''Specificity or True Negative Rate (TNR):''' TN/N = TN/(TN+FP)
** '''False Negative Rate (FNR):''' FN/P = FN/(TP+FN) = 1 - TPR
** '''Fallout or False Positive Rate (FPR):''' FP/N = TN/(FP+TN) = 1 - TNR
** '''Precision or Positive Predictive Value (PPV):''' PPV = TP / (TP + FP)
** '''False Discovery Rate (FDR):''' FP/(TP + FP) = 1 - PPV
** '''Negative Predictive Value (NPV):'''  TN / (TN+FN)
** '''Accuracy (ACC):''' (TP+TN) / (P+N) = (TP+TN) / (TP + FP + FN + TN)
* '''Pareto Optimality:''' an individual is '''Pareto''' if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives
** The set of all Pareto individuals is known as the '''Pareto frontier'''

=== <u>Lab Notes</u> ===
Demonstrating multi-objective optimization:
* By modifying the code to the first half of the lab we get a graph of the objective space as follows:
[[files/Screen Shot 2020-09-03 at 7.34.43 PM.png|frameless]]
* After changing the formula to evaluate symbolic regression to a more difficult problem, the main evolutionary algorithm returns a resulting dataset that looks like this:
[[files/Screen Shot 2020-09-03 at 7.34.56 PM.png|frameless]]

The orange and red plots represent tree size and the blue and green plots represent mean standard error. The tree size increases over time while the mean standard error drops within the first few generations.

* Finally, to visualize our objective space and corresponding pareto front, we get a plot that looks like this:

== August 26th, 2020 ==

=== <u>Team Meeting Notes</u> ===
* '''Genetic Programming:'''
** Instead of taking an individual and having a function evaluator to obtain objective scores, the indivudal is the function itself
** '''Tree Representations:'''
*** Nodes are called primitves and represent functions
*** Leaves are called terminals and represent parameters
*** Tree is converted to a lisp preordered parse tree (operator followed by inputs)
**'''Mutation in GP'''
***Mutation can involve:
****Inserting a node or subtree
****Deleting a node or subtree
****Changing a node
=== <u>Lab 2 Pt. 1: Symbolic Regression</u> ===
* Process: Used DEAP's PrimitiveTree class instead of a list so that individuals can be represented as a tree structure to mirror genetic programming concepts
* Code Additions:
** Added two primitives: exp and log10
* Resulting Output Graph:

=== <u>Team Meeting Notes</u> ===
* '''Genetic Algorithms:''' With genetic algorithms, each new generation is created through mutation of individuals in the previous population. It will eventually produce the best individual.
* '''Keywords:'''
** Individual: one specific candidate
** Population: group of individuals
** Objective: value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize
** Fitness: relative comparison to rest of poulation
** Evaluation: a function that computes the objective of an individual
** Selection: survival of the fittest
*** Fitness proportionate: greater fitness leads to a higher value probability for mating
*** Tounrnament: several tournaments among individuals, winners are selected for mating
** Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
** Mutate: introduces random modifications to maintain diversity
** Algorithms: various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual

=== <u>Lab Notes</u> ===
# One Max Problem
#* Goal: Find a bit string containing all 1s with a set length
#* Developed a simple genetic algorithm problem with the goal of maximizing the objective

#** [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], (98.0,)
# N Queens Problem
#* Goal: Determine a configuration of n queens on a nxn chessboard such that no queen can be taken by one another.
#* Developed another simple genetic algorithm problem with the goal of minimizing the objective
#** Minimize the number of queens that can be taken by one another
#** Results from one execution:[[files/ChrisOzgoNQueens.png|left|thumb]]
