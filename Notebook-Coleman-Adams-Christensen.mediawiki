==== Team Meeting Notes: ====
Stocks Presented First: I presented the Buy Hold comparison

EZCGP Presented Second: They talked about improving their visualizations and developing new mating methods. I liked their code it was interesting to see how it worked compared to Stocks. 

NLP Presented Third: They talked about fixing a lot of their problems they had last semester and their Amazon dataset. 

Modularity Presented Last: They talked a lot about ARL(adaptive representation through learning) and the things that they were able to do with them and the things they hope to do with them next semester.

==== Team Meeting Notes: ====
Final Presentations are in five days. 
==== Subteam Notes: ====
We discussed our final presentation and the content in it. Each team member has their own slide/pair of slides. We are going to discuss our best performing individuals and what we want to do with EMADE next semester. 
==== Individual Notes: ====
I am in charge of the slides on our Buy Hold comparison which compares the performance of an individual against buying the stock and the beginning of the period and selling it at the end of the period.

==== Subteam Notes: ====
We discussed our run from last week and the individual which preformed well. The individual was simple and based on bollinger bands. We also discussed more technical indicators. Stochastic RSI which is good for the short term, AROON which the old team used, VWAP which determines the average price over a period by weighting the price by the volume, and VWMA which is the moving average version of VWAP

==== Subteam Notes: ====
We worked this week to visualize our EMADE results and work on the presentation. 
==== Individual Notes: ====
I am in charge of the conclusions slide. I calculated the area under the curve of our individually tuned pareto individuals. I came to the conclusion that MOGP was the best option in terms of creating an accurate algorithm and creating a large number of pareto individuals.

==== Sub Team Notes: ====
We used one hot encoding on "Sex" and "Embarkment" to increase performance. Most of the choices made in the reference notebook were kept. A team Git Hub was created to share the train data. We created a slack chat to keep track of our algorithms performance and ensure pareto optimality. I missed two meetings because of scheduling conflicts.

In this meeting we assigned sub teams for the rest of the semester. These teams were assigned using our self graded scores on python and machine learning. The teams were then assigned in a way to where all teams would be pareto optimal. We then introduced the first assignment for the sub teams where we will be making codominant solutions to the titanic problem. The gist of the problem is that we are using machine learning to predict whether a passenger of the titanic survives or not based off of their characteristics.

==== Team Meeting Notes: ====
This week we learned about how to evaluate algorithms for preference when mating. We focused on taking taking the raw vectors that result from evaluation and transforming those into fitness scores that can be ranked against each other. We learned about how an evaluation method is not always perfect and will have false positives and negatives. The example used was one of a picture of fruit where there was 11 apples and 12 non-apples. Evaluating by saying every red fruit was an apple gave us five false positives and three false negatives. Next, we learned about the objective space and Pareto optimality. The objective space is a graphical representation of every individuals fitness using the evaluations as the axes. Pareto optimality is when an individual is not outperformed by any other individual in all evaluation categories. Finally, we learned about the different methods of ranking individuals beyond pareto which are NSGA2 and SPEA2
