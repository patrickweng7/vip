'''Final Presentation Notes:'''
* Met for 3 hours to listen to and give sub-teams' final presentations.
* Our slides for the final presentation can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kEOKk6Esu_CEE2FzyLRO6HDHYNDNhkNw4JH3fD7fRV0/edit?usp=sharing.
* I presented slides 50-52 (changed from last week) on the topic of novelty detection. To reiterate a few of my points, our objective is fairly basic: to introduce new layer types into the population. However, we realized that this is not effective – we already have a diverse population with the expected layer types (see slide 51 for first generation statistics). This is all of the layers currently implemented in EMADE. Therefore, our evaluation method always returns 0 (tested to five generations). Obviously, our current idea of novelty is fairly constrained: a simple binary includes / doesn’t include metric. We can add more layers (like dropout) or utilize a frequency-based comparison, but these will not solve our problem. Instead, we want our novelty functions to reward intelligent architectures. For example, the AlexNet and VGG-16 architectures feature stacks of convolutional layers followed by a pooling layer (i.e. the paradigm is to decrease the spatial resolution of the representation while increasing the number of channels). Therefore, we want to instead track modules (which were introduced by the two Camerons). You might think that this will run into the same issue. However, the number of modules is theoretically unbounded whereas the number of layers is not. A side effect of promoting these submodules: deeper networks!
* You can find an overview of recent CNN architectures here: https://theaisummer.com/cnn-architectures/. Note their design principles and their modular components -- we are trying to emulate this within the NAS branch.
* I made a couple of runs of EMADE on PACE up to five generation but found (as noted above) that the form of novelty detection I implemented would not work under the previous iteration of our NAS branch. In the future, I will have to make a slight modification to these methods to account for modules instead of layers. It should be a relatively simple adjustment but we did not introduce modules until the end of this semester and so I did not have time to test them.
* Notes from other teams' presentations: 

1. Image Processing introduced new geometric crossover methods and used a multi-label dataset. They compared performances using NSGA2 and NSGA3 as well as various filters.

2. NLP focuses on QA using the SQUAD dataset. Their model is based on BiDAF. They ran into several issues over the semester and so re-focused on improving existing model. They introduced NNLearner2 to accept multiple data pairs and created a bidirectional attention layer. Their future work includes implementing multi-output regression individuals. 

3. Stocks created individuals which improve upon all baselines presented in their comparison paper. Notably, their individual of interest utilizes ARGMIN as its learner, and it is not immediately clear why. They will continue to find pareto optimal individuals in preparation for a paper.

4. Modularity compared ARL runs and discussed their Collab infrastructure. Their future work includes incorporating the stock team's work and creating a paper.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Used this period to review our plans for the final presentation and ensure that all members were capable of completing runs.
* Our slides for the final presentation can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kEOKk6Esu_CEE2FzyLRO6HDHYNDNhkNw4JH3fD7fRV0/edit?usp=sharing.
* Cameron Bennett merged all of our work onto the nn-vip-final branch: https://github.gatech.edu/cwhaley9/emade/tree/nn-vip-final. He also added some new novelty evaluation methods which I can use.
* I will be performing runs this week using this branch to test the novelty evaluation functions. After the merge, there were some missing changes from my own branch, and so I had to port these over manually. This took some time to debug.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met for 30 minutes to review the final presentation and assign slides. This weekend we will run some experiments to evaluate our changes over the semester. We are also looking to merge all of our work into one branch for these runs. However, some of our work is still experimental and so we might save it for a future semester.
* I amended the layer frequency tracking code to account for ADFs here: https://github.gatech.edu/cwhaley9/emade/commit/12ef8e31a892118ddc2882ac8aa233ae1c82f5b3. The principal change was to replace all instances of ADFs with their associated layer frequencies. Note that ADFs cannot be nested.
* I implemented a basic evaluation method for novelty detection here: https://github.gatech.edu/cwhaley9/emade/commit/bc8637505302f0b1f363235f7452e8465fee9d2b. To do this, I had to modify some of the evaluate methods in EMADE.py and pass an additional kwargs. I will also think of more complex evaluation methods. Currently, I give a reward if an individual contains a layer type not included within the previous generation. However, we do not use many layers and so this might saturate quickly (AKA give a value of 0 to most individuals). Therefore, I want to incorporate frequency rather than a binary includes / doesn't include.
* Our slides for the final presentation can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kEOKk6Esu_CEE2FzyLRO6HDHYNDNhkNw4JH3fD7fRV0/edit?usp=sharing. I am responsible for slides 12 - 15 (layer novelty detection results) as well as parts of slide 26 (additional documentation) where I can present improvements to running EMADE on PACE.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met with team for one hour.
* As a sub-team, we discussed possible evaluation methods for novelty detection and came up with several ideas. For example, we might consider an analog of the Lp norm, and reward individuals based on their novelty in different magnitudes.
* I will implement these for our next meeting so that we can begin running experiments.

In the future, I will work to better integrate this with the existing Statistics table generation (notice the commented code in this code). In any case, the Statistics table is being properly populated with this new column.
* I still need to incorporate ADFs into this tracking, and will work on this over the weekend.

'''Hackathon Notes:'''
* Attended hackathon for approximately 3-4 hours.
* I realized that the shared conda environment I was using on PACE was not stable (Cameron Whaley was making some changes). Therefore, I had to spend some time installing the dependencies in my own environment. This took about 10 GB of space, placing me just underneath the PACE limit (~14.8 / 15 GB). This is problematic because future work might place me over. Therefore, we discussed the possibility of a stable, shared environment that would not contribute to our individual quotas.
* While my environment was installing, I continued working to cleanup the EMADE codebase. These changes can be found here: https://github.gatech.edu/cwhaley9/emade/tree/nn-vip-refactor. For example, I reduced the complexity of the worker algorithm here: https://github.gatech.edu/cwhaley9/emade/commit/9cb966e3ab4333e466138249db4669cb61c8ac00. However, we do not intend to introduce these changes this semester. We want to rule out the possibility of introducing new bugs when we should be freezing the codebase for our final experiments. Nevertheless, this is an important initiative because it will allow us to better tailor EMADE to our own needs (evolving neural networks).
* During this cleaning process, I became more familiar with the master / worker algorithms and got a better sense where I might introduce new code.
* Finally, I started fixing the bugs introduced in the layer frequency code I committed last week.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met for one hour.
* We discussed some of the issues I mentioned below and I was able to use the hour as a work session. Using a debugger, I determined that this code was faulting on nested ADFs and was not appropriately tracking layer frequencies. I worked on modifying this.
* As I started adding in more hooks to the master / worker algorithms in EMADE.py, I also started to clean up some of the codebase and intend to merge some of these changes in the future. For example, I replaced the print -> flush paradigm with print alone (because Python appends \n when printing, and so flushing is done automatically). I also noticed some unnecessary complexity within the worker algorithm and will work to reduce this.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met for one hour and provided scrum updates.
* Over the weekend, I implemented basic logic to track layer frequencies. You can find these changes here: https://github.gatech.edu/cwhaley9/emade/commit/ea2c3780a78a39006f993de4e9ac9d488c50dc83.
* These changes required interacting with the database and so I had to familiarize myself with some of EMADE's underlying SQL infrastructure (e.g. the code in the sql_connection_orm_*.py file).
* Currently, whenever individuals are added to the database these method will be called so that their layer frequencies are also collated into a generation-wide Counter.
* Unfortunately, I encountered some bugs when running this code on PACE, and this was a motivating factor to switch to local development. I will be focusing on these issues in the near future. For example, this method is not called appropriately on the first generation and so I will have to handle the first generation separately.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met for one hour.
* After finishing the configuration scripts for EMADE on PACE, I realized that development was still tricky because I did not have access to a debugger on PACE. Therefore, I setup EMADE on my local machine (macOS) and consolidated the documentation for this process here:
    conda create -n pace-env python=3.8
    conda install --channel "conda-forge" numpy pandas tensorflow==2.6.0 keras==2.6.0 scipy psutil lxml matplotlib PyWavelets sqlalchemy networkx cython scikit-image mysqlclient pymysql scikit-learn tensorflow-datasets==4.3 sep nltk textblob spectral "setuptools>=57,<58" && pip install xgboost lmfit multiprocess hmmlearn deap==1.2.2 opencv-python keras-pickle-wrapper
    bash reinstall.sh
* I spent some time familiarizing myself with parts of the codebase that I would be interacting with to develop novelty detection. I also stepped through a run of EMADE using a debugger to get a better understanding of the flow of execution.
* I also noted that the hanging time in the CIFAR-10 generation script was out of our control.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* General scrum updates from each sub-team.
* I finished consolidating the documentation for running EMADE on PACE. I also wrote three bash scripts to automate the setup process, cutting the the required time investment from 2 - 3 hours down to just 6 minutes. 13% of the time (48 s) is spent cloning the repository & 62% (3:42 s) downloading CIFAR-10, leaving just 25% (1:30 s) for general setup. Space usage is also just 5.3 GB / 15 GB max. I think that further improvements can be made by focusing on the time spent downloading CIFAR-10. The download script seems to hang for the majority of the time before beginning the download, and so I believe there is an issue here.
* You can find this documentation [https://github.gatech.edu/cwhaley9/emade/wiki/Running-EMADE-on-PACE-using-CIFAR-10 here]. It guides users through the setup from start to finish, with helpful guides linked along the way.
* The three bash scripts were added in [https://github.gatech.edu/cwhaley9/emade/commit/f333b2e7f3bc99de044f522545a9c3534a2d8d14 this commit]. They will create the MySQL infrastructure needed by EMADE, personalize the PBS files, and provide convenient utilities to start an EMADE run using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* With this completed, I can refocus on the novelty detection task. I spent a lot of time previously debugging setup issues, and even getting a single run was difficult (especially before we could clone EMADE onto PACE using git). In our 15 minutes sub-team meeting today, I worked with Devesh to determine an appropriate method of tracking generation-wide layer frequencies, and ironed out a general plan to tackle this. We identified certain areas of the code that might be modified to achieve this.

* I am personally continuing to work on general documentation improvements. I had an idea to write some scripts to automate the PACE onboarding process, as there are many steps and they are easy to forget. This would save members a lot of time debugging and ensures that we all have a consistent developer experience on PACE.

* Regrouping after midterm presentation to discuss future plans and specific action items to complete before the final presentation.
* In the latter half of the semester, we will put special focus on the novelty detection task and attempt to reward novelty in individuals. Now that we have a strong baseline to compare against, this will be more straightforward.
* As presented, I developed a simple method to count layer frequencies within an individual which will be collated into a master count for every generation. This master count will be used to derive a novelty metric. This method can be viewed [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/167Jl4jEKVsY1c1Y12fLJIL_RXw7amRiPRUJPDiU1b5c/edit#slide=id.gfb025140e1_1_0 here].

'''Midterm Presentation Notes:'''
* We gave our presentation on our NAS subteam progress. We discussed improvements such as time stopping, new analysis tools, tokenization changes, and minor novelty detection changes. This presentation also presented several strong baselines for our future work to compare against. We had several experimental runs.
* Important points:
    1. NLP subteam shared that the EMADE branch `EMADE-304-allow-cachev2-to-consume-aligned-datapairs` is useful for their Q&A tasks. They merged this with nn-vip and so we might need to do the same in the future.
    2. Image processing team reminded us to consider the selection algorithm -- oftentimes our focus is downstream of the master algorithm but this is still important to vary when evaluating EMADE's performance on our tasks.
    3. Stocks subteam is trying to recreate a paper and compare use it as a baseline for their semester's work. I think this is a great idea because it offers a measurable goal (rather than comparing performance internally).
    4. Modularity team is working with ARLs and we might consider using their work to improve the performance of our own branch.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met from 1 - 5 PM as part of a team-wide hackathon.
* I spent the time attempting to clone my personal EMADE fork onto PACE and was successfully able to do so.
* Shared this with the rest of the sub-team and created these steps:
    1. Fork https://github.gatech.edu/cwhaley9/emade.
    2. Create an SSH key on PACE & on your GaTech GitHub account (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).
    3. Clone the `nn-vip` branch of your personal fork onto PACE using SSH: `git clone -b nn-vip <remote_repo>`. The repository takes ~5 GB, so make sure that you have enough storage on PACE. You can check this using pace-quota.
    4. Add Cameron’s fork as a remote: `git remote add upstream git@github.gatech.edu:cwhaley9/emade.git`.
    5. To avoid duplicate merge commits, read this post for best practices: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38641546/github-clean-up-fork-after-pull-request. If something goes wrong after creating a PR to Cameron’s fork, see this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9646167/clean-up-a-fork-and-restart-it-from-the-upstream/9646323#9646323.
    6. `cd emade` and run `cp -R pace my_pace`. Do NOT add your personal credentials to any of the files in `pace/`. These will be erroneously tracked by git. Instead, make the required changes to the files in `my_pace/` because these are ignored by git.
* Reduced size of repository to just 4 GB after deleting unused and unnecessary files.
* This should greatly speed development work on PACE because we no longer have to SCP files between PACE and our local computers.
* The next step is to better document the developer setup process on PACE so that all of this documentation is contained in one location.
* Once this is done, I can work to implement the layer frequencies method again.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met for an hour with sub-team to give updates on our weekly tasks.
* Discussed issues with the latest merge onto the nn-vip branch, and initially decided to work off of Cameron Whaley's fork while the issue on that branch was sorted out. I fixed this issue by reverted the previous three commits and merging [https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/pull/200 a PR] onto this branch.
* Setup a potential work meeting on Monday to work on some of our tasks together.
* Mentioned possibility of pruning Whaley's EMADE fork to the bare minimum necessary for our team's development on PACE. This would greatly simplify the developer experience on our team.
* Will implement my task this weekend now that the branch issue is sorted out.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Scrum update included our addition of the CIFAR-10 dataset and then also some points on our novelty detection work. We currently have implemented a baseline for detecting all-1 or all-0 predictions.
* Met with sub-team afterwards for 20 minutes to discuss tasks. I brought up my issue with point #3 below, and it was suggested to loop through each evaluated individual in the main evolutionary loop, convert that individual into its string representation, and then parse this string to count layer frequencies. Cameron Whaley sent me code to do the parsing that I can work from, but it does require slight modification to work for our neural network primitives.
* Taking a step back, I'd like to improve the developer workflow within EMADE. There are a couple of pressing issues. 

    1. First and foremost, the EMADE repository is extremely large (because it includes raw datasets), and this pushes it over the 15 GB PACE storage limit. Therefore, we are unable to directly push/pull from PACE, and instead must SCP the necessary files between our personal computer and PACE. This is not particularly efficient and makes development troublesome. For that reason, I am looking into creating our own fork of EMADE, and deleting datasets that we don't use and cleaning up the repository. 
    2. I want to develop a better unit testing process so that we don't have to verify changes by submitting jobs to PACE alone. 
    3. I want to clean up the codebase in some areas. Some simple ideas include replacing the print(), flush() paradigm with logging, and breaking up monolithic functions into smaller pieces.  
    4. Finally, consider paring down EMADE just for running on PACE. Currently, the codebase includes a lot of complexity to handle running on Windows, which can be removed to decrease the size of the repository.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Cameron Bennett was missing from this meeting, so it was shorter and was used as a work-session (with everyone on the call).
* I gave a quick update on my task but had to leave early.
* For the task, my current idea is as follows:
    1. Add a pickled column called layerFrequencies to the History table in sql_connection_orm_base.py. This will be used to store our generation-specific layer dictionary.
    2. In EMADE.py, this is table is updated once per generation at line 1076. Update this method (add_history() in sql_connection_orm_master.py) to include the generation-specific layer dictionary.
    3. Look at each evaluated individual in a generation and add add its layer counts to this dictionary dictionary.

Currently having trouble with the third point, because I still do not have a good mental image for what an individual looks like and what attributes it has. Will ask further on Slack and during our meeting Monday.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Attended hour long presentation given by both Camerons on EMADE.py and its main evolutionary algorithm. Learned a lot about the overall architecture and flow of execution. Asked several questions related to my task and developed a better idea of how I might count layer frequencies per generation. My initial idea was to track this in the worker algorithm by passing a dictionary as a parameter, but I realized after this discussion that this would not be feasible (partly due to the multiprocessing setup).
* The recording of this presentation is available in the #neural-architecture-search channel.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met with sub-team for an hour to review weekly progress and discuss future directions for the team.
* I requested that we setup a meeting to review the EMADE architecture overall, with special focus on the main evolutionary algorithm in EMADE.py. This is relevant to our tasks and I thought it would be helpful to have a knowledge transfer from the more experienced team members.
* We looked at [https://paperswithcode.com/paper/how-does-supernet-help-in-neural-architecture/review/ Supernet] as a potential future project for the team. Specifically, we considered the idea of weight sharing between different sub-networks in order to improve efficiency of training and improve the evolved individuals. 
* Agreed that this would be a major undertaking, and decided to sit on it a while longer to think about implementation details.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met with sub-team for an hour to ensure that we all had EMADE setup and had specific tasks to work on for the next meeting.
* I had some issues connecting to the MySQL instance running on PACE, but realized that I specified the wrong port number. Once I made this adjustment, I was able to run EMADE using the instructions provided on the Wiki (along with Cameron's YouTube video).
* I next setup a connection between this MySQL instance and my computer using MySQL workbench. This allowed me to view the results of the EMADE run, including the pareto front and various individuals.
* My task for this week is to construct a dictionary of layer frequencies across all individuals in a given generation. This information will be used to reward novel architectures, which might encourage EMADE to produce more novel individuals. To do this, I will have to modify either the main evolutionary loop or the evaluation method. Moreover, I need to make this dictionary available between generations.

* Talked with some students from last semester to get a better idea of what has already been done and what is left to do (if any work was unfinished from last semester). For example, last semester the NLP/NAS team were researching why their individuals produced by EMADE lacked complexity. This problem was not entirely solved.
* Agreed NAS should split from the NLP sub-team and considered some state of the art architectures that might be relevant (such as BERT).
* Settled on a problem related to question answering or machine translation, and decided to do more research outside of the meeting.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Attended final presentations for VIP from 6 - 9 PM.
* Listened to all teams share their progress over the semester.
* Of particular interest to me was hearing some of my own team's progress. As we often work in sub-teams within our sub-team, it was exciting to learn more about the work others were doing at a detailed level.
* I gave the part of our presentation on visualization. I also noticed that some members of the team were already using the new iteration of the visualization script.
* Received general feedback, some of which was shared with other teams across the VIP. We should look to be more "scientific" in our findings, using statistical tests to show improved performance rather than hand-waving results.
* I enjoyed other groups' use of GIFs to animate their pareto fronts, which our team could also look at when considering the evolutionary process of an individual in ezCGP.
* I hope to merge a pull request into the master branch of ezCGP by the end of term. I also look forward to continue working on ezCGP this fall now that I am familiarized with the workflow.
* Reflecting on my work in ezCGP, I felt that most of my time was spent learning the codebase. The visualization code touched a lot of its parts and I found this work super helpful to me personally. Moreover, my work was immediately used by other members of the team; I'm glad that my first-semester project was used in practice.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Reviewed last week's progress on the Titanic dataset.
* Discussed next week's assignment (including the presentation and several motivating ideas).
'''Sub-Team Notes:'''
* Met with team for 30 minutes after class to discuss our submission for this week's assignments.
* Ensured Pareto optimality of our results. You can see our Pareto front in the graphic below.
* Organized another meeting for this Friday to complete the next assignment.
[[files/Spr21group3pareto.png|none|thumb]]
'''Personal Notes:'''
* For this week's assignment, I applied several models to our team's preprocessed Titanic dataset. Namely, decision trees, random forest, xgboost, SVM, and MLP. I figured that tree-based models would be the most fruitful (because of their simplicity) and I was largely correct.
* My random forest implementation achieved the greatest accuracy of all methods (82% accuracy, with average results for FPR and FNR as shown above). My other methods performed fairly well and some even approached random forest in accuracy.
* I used sklearn's GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters for all models. Moreover, I considered class imbalances when fitting random forest.
* Looking back, I would have spent more time doing feature engineering in order to improve the accuracy of my models. From a review of some public Kaggle notebooks, there were some interesting approaches to this that I did not consider when I first starting working on this dataset.
* In the future, I will also try to take greater account of class imbalances in the dataset. Moreover, I will try to use GridSearchCV's scoring parameter in order to optimize for metrics besides accuracy.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Lecture focused on multiple objectives.
* Gene pool is the set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation. GA = set of value and GP = tree structure.
* Search space is over all possible genomes (which are scored).
* Classification measures -> confusion matrix consisting of true positive, false negative, false positive, true negative.
* Maximization Measures:
    * Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR; hit rate or recall) = TP/P = TP(TP+FN)
    * Specificity (SPC)/True Negative Rate (TNR) = TN/N = TN/(TN + FP)
* Minimization Measures:
    * False Negative Rate (FNR) = FN/P = FN/(TP+FN)
    * Fallout or False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP/(FP + TN)
* Other measures exist.
* Pareto Optimality -- an individual is Pareto optimal if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individiual on all objectives. Set of all Pareto individuals = Pareto frontier, and they represent unique contributions. Therefore, we drive selection by favoring these individuals.
* Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) & Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA 2)

'''Lab #2 Notes:'''
*I fixed the issue I ran into last week by changing the arity of the two primitives that I added. After running the evolutionary loop, I produced an individual using symbol regression that fit the provided data.
*You can find my notebook (and visualizations) [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oON4K222hF-DSf3iVSxXYf9-S9UQMaTK?usp=sharing here].
*We continued from last week's notebook in order to look at multi-objective genetic programming. We modified the code to minimize two objectives: mean squared error and the size of the tree.
*Rather than using a quartic polynomial, we use a harder equation made of powers of sin, cos, and tan.
*We define a function to compute pareto dominance and use this to visualize the objective space. We use different color dots to indicate which individuals dominate or are dominated.
*Using DEAP's implementation of the Mu plus Lambda evolutionary algorithm, we run an evolutionary loop that finds the best individual in our objective space.
*We see that in the first chart, the MSE drops quickly while the tree size grows over time. However, this chart does not show how well our population is doing on both objectives (which requires a pareto front).
*[[files/AUCsp21.png|thumb]]The strength of the pareto front is measured by the area under the curve. We implemented our own version of this GP problem in order to decrease the AUC by 25%. To do this, I tuned the hyper parameters of the given algorithm, and found that by decreasing the mutation probability (to a low value such as 0.01), the AUC would drop significantly. In my case, the AUC almost halved, producing the final chart shown on the right. The AUC value was 1.12 (compared to an initial value between 2 and 3).
*Finally, we take a look at strongly typed genetic programming, which involves programming types. This requires care that we use primitives and terminals that our trees can produce.
*Ephemeral constants are terminals generated by a function instead of a pre-defined value.
*We can control bloat (to limit tree size) by adding static limits to our code, setting objectives to minimize tree size, and modifying the evaluation function to give bloated trees worse fitness values.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Focus on genetic programming.
* Here, we represent a program as a tree structure. Nodes are called primitives and represent functions. Leaves are terminals and represent parameters. Output is produced at root of tree.
* Tree is stored as lisp preordered parse tree.
* Crossover accomplished by swapping subtrees.
* Mutations change structure of the tree (for example, inserting or removing a node).
* Can be used to approximate arbitrary functions (such as sin).

'''Lab #2 Notes:'''
* Focused on genetic programming.
* This paradigm uses tree structures to represent class members.
* We initialized a tree structure, and I added add and subtract as my two new primitives.
* Next, we defined an evaluation function which we can use on the function version of our tree.
* Genetic programming can be thought of as finding the best combination of primitives given objectives to minimize or maximize.
* I added the GP node replacement mutation to the code. This caused my graph to reach a minimum faster but it also resulted in higher variability of the max.
* Finally, we coded the main evolutionary algorithm and added some graphing.
* I ran into a ValueError in the evolutionary loop that I was unable to solve. When I added some error handling however, I was able to produce some function that had a very low fitness. Currently working on fixing this.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Introduction to the basics of genetic algorithms and relevant vocabulary.
* Keywords: selection (roulette, tournament), mate/crossover, mutate

'''Lab #1 Notes:'''
* DEAP is an evolutionary computation framework.
* Start the lab by defining types such as fitness, individual, and populations. Use of toolbox functions.
* Continue by initializing the population and assigning fitness values to each individual.
* Then, we begin the evolutionary process, using 40 generations.
* Selection is incorporated as part of the evolutionary process (producing offspring).
* The offspring are then manipulated using crossover and mutation.
* Next, we evaluate the offspring and replace the old population with the offspring.
* Finally, we add statistics and run this process.
* We find that the algorithm often achieves the global maximum fitness in 40 generations.
* I also reviewed some the DEAP documentation.
* We next focus on the N Queens problem.
* We start by assigning one queen to each row and column. Then, we count conflicts along the diagonals to measure fitness.
* Our algorithm utilizes partially matched crossover for mating. This allows us to preserve information from parents when forming offspring.
* Then, we took a look at different mutation functions and attempted to implement our own.
* When adjusting parameters, we found that increasing the population size increased the probability of finding the global minimum (0) in 100 generations.
* Finally, using data visualizations we find that the average and minimum fitness of our populations stabilize around 20-30 generations.
