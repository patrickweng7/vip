'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Attended hour long presentation given by both Camerons on EMADE.py and its main evolutionary algorithm. Learned a lot about the overall architecture and flow of execution. Asked several questions related to my task and developed a better idea of how I might count layer frequencies per generation. My initial idea was to track this in the worker algorithm by passing a dictionary as a parameter, but I realized after this discussion that this would not be feasible (partly due to the multiprocessing setup).
* The recording of this presentation is available in the #neural-architecture-search channel.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met with sub-team for an hour to review weekly progress and discuss future directions for the team.
* I requested that we setup a meeting to review the EMADE architecture overall, with special focus on the main evolutionary algorithm in EMADE.py. This is relevant to our tasks and I thought it would be helpful to have a knowledge transfer from the more experienced team members.
* We looked at [https://paperswithcode.com/paper/how-does-supernet-help-in-neural-architecture/review/ Supernet] as a potential future project for the team. Specifically, we considered the idea of weight sharing between different sub-networks in order to improve efficiency of training and improve the evolved individuals. 
* Agreed that this would be a major undertaking, and decided to sit on it a while longer to think about implementation details.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Reviewed progress of all sub-teams in a scrum setting. 
* Our team presented some of the tasks we have created for the upcoming week, including novelty detection, CIFAR-10 templating, and reuse adjustments.
* Met with sub-team after meeting, where I discussed my ticket in greater detail. We walked through the main evolutionary loop, and I gained a better understanding of which methods I would have to modify.
* Learned a bit more about EMADE in general, including how to analyze results (using Cameron's analysis library) along with how to speed up training (by adjusting num_instances in the dataset input .xml files).
* Followed [https://docs.pace.gatech.edu/interactiveJobs/jupyterInt/ this] tutorial to run Jupyter notebooks on PACE.

'''Sub-Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met with sub-team for an hour to ensure that we all had EMADE setup and had specific tasks to work on for the next meeting.
* I had some issues connecting to the MySQL instance running on PACE, but realized that I specified the wrong port number. Once I made this adjustment, I was able to run EMADE using the instructions provided on the Wiki (along with Cameron's YouTube video).
* I next setup a connection between this MySQL instance and my computer using MySQL workbench. This allowed me to view the results of the EMADE run, including the pareto front and various individuals.
* My task for this week is to construct a dictionary of layer frequencies across all individuals in a given generation. This information will be used to reward novel architectures, which might encourage EMADE to produce more novel individuals. To do this, I will have to modify either the main evolutionary loop or the evaluation method. Moreover, I need to make this dictionary available between generations.

You may or may not have access to this, but some of the items include: triviality and novelty detection, speeding up EMADE (a critical issue because EMADE runs tend to go over the PACE limit of 8 hours; some problem areas include tokenization and some EMADE data structures), adding some test scripts, and debugging the layer swap functionality.
* Discussed the papers mentioned below and considered how to adapt/implement some of their ideas in our branch.
* Set a weekly meeting time for Fridays from 2 - 3 PM.

'''NLP Brainstorm Meeting Notes:'''
* Met for 30-45 minutes to discuss a possible NLP research direction for this semester.
* Talked with some students from last semester to get a better idea of what has already been done and what is left to do (if any work was unfinished from last semester). For example, last semester the NLP/NAS team were researching why their individuals produced by EMADE lacked complexity. This problem was not entirely solved.
* Agreed NAS should split from the NLP sub-team and considered some state of the art architectures that might be relevant (such as BERT).
* Settled on a problem related to question answering or machine translation, and decided to do more research outside of the meeting.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Attended final presentations for VIP from 6 - 9 PM.
* Listened to all teams share their progress over the semester.
* Of particular interest to me was hearing some of my own team's progress. As we often work in sub-teams within our sub-team, it was exciting to learn more about the work others were doing at a detailed level.
* I gave the part of our presentation on visualization. I also noticed that some members of the team were already using the new iteration of the visualization script.
* Received general feedback, some of which was shared with other teams across the VIP. We should look to be more "scientific" in our findings, using statistical tests to show improved performance rather than hand-waving results.
* I enjoyed other groups' use of GIFs to animate their pareto fronts, which our team could also look at when considering the evolutionary process of an individual in ezCGP.
* I hope to merge a pull request into the master branch of ezCGP by the end of term. I also look forward to continue working on ezCGP this fall now that I am familiarized with the workflow.
* Reflecting on my work in ezCGP, I felt that most of my time was spent learning the codebase. The visualization code touched a lot of its parts and I found this work super helpful to me personally. Moreover, my work was immediately used by other members of the team; I'm glad that my first-semester project was used in practice.

* Previous iteration is close to finished, but we decided to change some formatting (such as putting node number and arguments on separate lines) and adding argument names.
* Agreed to merge the visualization branch (mentioned below) to master once these changes were made.
* Visualized some individuals and discussed why shorter networks seem to be preferred (when deeper networks typically perform better on CIFAR-10).

'''Personal Notes:'''
* Completed formatting and added named arguments on 4/18.
* Talked with Rodd Talebi and became more familiarized with the ezCGP codebase.

* Ensured Pareto optimality of our results. You can see our Pareto front in the graphic below.
* Organized another meeting for this Friday to complete the next assignment.
[[files/Spr21group3pareto.png|none|thumb]]
'''Personal Notes:'''
* For this week's assignment, I applied several models to our team's preprocessed Titanic dataset. Namely, decision trees, random forest, xgboost, SVM, and MLP. I figured that tree-based models would be the most fruitful (because of their simplicity) and I was largely correct.
* My random forest implementation achieved the greatest accuracy of all methods (82% accuracy, with average results for FPR and FNR as shown above). My other methods performed fairly well and some even approached random forest in accuracy.
* I used sklearn's GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters for all models. Moreover, I considered class imbalances when fitting random forest.
* Looking back, I would have spent more time doing feature engineering in order to improve the accuracy of my models. From a review of some public Kaggle notebooks, there were some interesting approaches to this that I did not consider when I first starting working on this dataset.
* In the future, I will also try to take greater account of class imbalances in the dataset. Moreover, I will try to use GridSearchCV's scoring parameter in order to optimize for metrics besides accuracy.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Lecture focused on multiple objectives.
* Gene pool is the set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation. GA = set of value and GP = tree structure.
* Search space is over all possible genomes (which are scored).
* Classification measures -> confusion matrix consisting of true positive, false negative, false positive, true negative.
* Maximization Measures:
    * Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR; hit rate or recall) = TP/P = TP(TP+FN)
    * Specificity (SPC)/True Negative Rate (TNR) = TN/N = TN/(TN + FP)
* Minimization Measures:
    * False Negative Rate (FNR) = FN/P = FN/(TP+FN)
    * Fallout or False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP/(FP + TN)
* Other measures exist.
* Pareto Optimality -- an individual is Pareto optimal if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individiual on all objectives. Set of all Pareto individuals = Pareto frontier, and they represent unique contributions. Therefore, we drive selection by favoring these individuals.
* Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) & Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA 2)

'''Lab #2 Notes:'''
*I fixed the issue I ran into last week by changing the arity of the two primitives that I added. After running the evolutionary loop, I produced an individual using symbol regression that fit the provided data.
*You can find my notebook (and visualizations) [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oON4K222hF-DSf3iVSxXYf9-S9UQMaTK?usp=sharing here].
*We continued from last week's notebook in order to look at multi-objective genetic programming. We modified the code to minimize two objectives: mean squared error and the size of the tree.
*Rather than using a quartic polynomial, we use a harder equation made of powers of sin, cos, and tan.
*We define a function to compute pareto dominance and use this to visualize the objective space. We use different color dots to indicate which individuals dominate or are dominated.
*Using DEAP's implementation of the Mu plus Lambda evolutionary algorithm, we run an evolutionary loop that finds the best individual in our objective space.
*We see that in the first chart, the MSE drops quickly while the tree size grows over time. However, this chart does not show how well our population is doing on both objectives (which requires a pareto front).
*[[files/AUCsp21.png|thumb]]The strength of the pareto front is measured by the area under the curve. We implemented our own version of this GP problem in order to decrease the AUC by 25%. To do this, I tuned the hyper parameters of the given algorithm, and found that by decreasing the mutation probability (to a low value such as 0.01), the AUC would drop significantly. In my case, the AUC almost halved, producing the final chart shown on the right. The AUC value was 1.12 (compared to an initial value between 2 and 3).
*Finally, we take a look at strongly typed genetic programming, which involves programming types. This requires care that we use primitives and terminals that our trees can produce.
*Ephemeral constants are terminals generated by a function instead of a pre-defined value.
*We can control bloat (to limit tree size) by adding static limits to our code, setting objectives to minimize tree size, and modifying the evaluation function to give bloated trees worse fitness values.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Focus on genetic programming.
* Here, we represent a program as a tree structure. Nodes are called primitives and represent functions. Leaves are terminals and represent parameters. Output is produced at root of tree.
* Tree is stored as lisp preordered parse tree.
* Crossover accomplished by swapping subtrees.
* Mutations change structure of the tree (for example, inserting or removing a node).
* Can be used to approximate arbitrary functions (such as sin).

'''Lab #2 Notes:'''
* Focused on genetic programming.
* This paradigm uses tree structures to represent class members.
* We initialized a tree structure, and I added add and subtract as my two new primitives.
* Next, we defined an evaluation function which we can use on the function version of our tree.
* Genetic programming can be thought of as finding the best combination of primitives given objectives to minimize or maximize.
* I added the GP node replacement mutation to the code. This caused my graph to reach a minimum faster but it also resulted in higher variability of the max.
* Finally, we coded the main evolutionary algorithm and added some graphing.
* I ran into a ValueError in the evolutionary loop that I was unable to solve. When I added some error handling however, I was able to produce some function that had a very low fitness. Currently working on fixing this.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Introduction to the basics of genetic algorithms and relevant vocabulary.
* Keywords: selection (roulette, tournament), mate/crossover, mutate

'''Lab #1 Notes:'''
* DEAP is an evolutionary computation framework.
* Start the lab by defining types such as fitness, individual, and populations. Use of toolbox functions.
* Continue by initializing the population and assigning fitness values to each individual.
* Then, we begin the evolutionary process, using 40 generations.
* Selection is incorporated as part of the evolutionary process (producing offspring).
* The offspring are then manipulated using crossover and mutation.
* Next, we evaluate the offspring and replace the old population with the offspring.
* Finally, we add statistics and run this process.
* We find that the algorithm often achieves the global maximum fitness in 40 generations.
* I also reviewed some the DEAP documentation.
* We next focus on the N Queens problem.
* We start by assigning one queen to each row and column. Then, we count conflicts along the diagonals to measure fitness.
* Our algorithm utilizes partially matched crossover for mating. This allows us to preserve information from parents when forming offspring.
* Then, we took a look at different mutation functions and attempted to implement our own.
* When adjusting parameters, we found that increasing the population size increased the probability of finding the global minimum (0) in 100 generations.
* Finally, using data visualizations we find that the average and minimum fitness of our populations stabilize around 20-30 generations.
