Lecture 1: Genetic Programming Introduction

Algorithm idea: each generation is created through mating/mutation of individuals in the previous population. Through numerous operations of this process, the fitness of the population will be optimized.

Keywords and Concepts

* Individual vs Population (population composed of individuals) 
* Objective: performance measure of an individual (goal is to maximize objective) 
* Fitness: relative measure of performance in comparison to other individuals 
* Selection: represents “survival of the fittest” 
* Fitness Proportionate: the greater fitness value, the higher probability of being selected for mating 
* Tournament: several tournaments among individuals determine selection 
* Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals 
** ie: Single point, double point crossover
* Mutation: introduces random modifications (to maintain diversity) 
** ie: Bit flip 

Genetic Algorithm Steps

# Randomly initialize population 
# Determine fitness 
# Repeat until fitness is good enough
## Select parent from population
## Perform mating/crossover
## Mutation
## Determine new fitness

*Types of problem that are good for genetic programming: problems with highly discontinuous, large search spaces
