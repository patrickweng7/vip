'''Genetic Algorithm'''

At any given time, there are multiple solutions to a problem
* '''Individual''' is a specific candidate in the population
* '''Population''' is a group of individuals
* '''Objective''' is a way to characterize individuals I'm trying to maximize or minimize
* '''Fitness''' is relative comparison to other individuals
* '''Evaluation''' spits out the DNA (computes the objective of the individual)
* '''Selection''' = 'survival of the fittest'
** fitness proportionate = greater fitness = greater probability of being selected for mating
** tournament = I can pick any number of individuals and whoever has the higher fitness moves to the next round and winners are selected for mating
** You're not directly tied to your fitness but your fitness will still affect the probability of you being selected
** But you can combine the two above (which is how it's set up in emade)
* '''Mate/Crossover''' is when we take two individuals (or more) and exchange DNA between them (mating)
* '''Mutation''' is when we make a small change to an individual -- purpose is to maintain diversity
** We make small changes to a child (after mating)

'''Algorithm'''

# Randomly initialize a population
# Evaluate the population to get the objective (determine fitness)
# Repeatâ€¦
#* Select parents
#* Crossover on parents creating population
#* Mutation of population
#* Determine fitness of population
:: ... until best individual is good enough
