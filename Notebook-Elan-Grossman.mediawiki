'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Covered Course Syllabus and Individual Responsibilities
* Intro to genetic programming
** Individual = a single subject defined as a set of features
** Population = a collection of individuals
** Objective = Maximization of a goal
** Fitness = Objective score relative to other individual scores
** Selection = Method to determine which experiment to try next through choosing a number of individuals to succeed
*** Emade algorithm uses a combination of tournament and proportionate selection techniques
** Mating = Exchanging features between individuals
** Mutation = Changing features in an individual
* Basic Genetic Programing algorithm is:
** Randomize or seed population
** Determine Objective and Fitness
** Repeat: Selection -> Mating -> Mutation -> Fitness Evaluation
* Used One-Max problem as an example of Genetic programming
* Covered Jupyter notebooks
