'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Covered Course Syllabus and Individual Responsibilities
* Intro to genetic programming
** Individual = a single subject defined as a set of features
** Population = a collection of individuals
** Objective = Maximization of a goal
** Fitness = Objective score relative to other individual scores
** Selection = Method to determine which experiment to try next through choosing a number of individuals to succeed
*** Emade algorithm uses a combination of tournament and proportionate selection techniques
** Mating = Exchanging features between individuals
** Mutation = Changing features in an individual
* Basic Genetic Programing algorithm is:
** Randomize or seed population
** Determine Objective and Fitness
** Repeat: Selection -> Mating -> Mutation -> Fitness Evaluation
* Used One-Max problem as an example of Genetic programming
* Covered Jupyter notebooks

'''Lab 1 Notes''' 
I began the lab by running each cell in the Jupiter notebook step by step, but started to get lost in the details. The creator method of the DEAP framework in particular is capable of producing multiple types of objects with the same function call. I assume this is to create a directed graph similar to tensorflow or spark. So I went over to the documentation at [[https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/]] to read more.

The creator method is a way to create classes on the fly using methods instead of files. In the documentation the example is that
 create("Foo", list, bar=dict, spam=1)
Is equivalent to
 class Foo(list):
    spam = 1
    def __init__(self):
        self.bar = dict()

Therefore,
 creator.create('Individual', list, fitness=creator.FitnessMax)
Is creating a class called "Individual" that inherits a list and contains an attribute that is an instance of the FitnessMax class.
This is better summarized in [[https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/basic/part1.html#creating-types]]
