== Titanic with GA ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Group had multiple meetings to try to catch up as we were behind in understanding.
* Got working somewhat on own, brought what I had to group to try to get full solution.
* Meeting 1 (Friday Sep 27)
     - Met in VIP to discuss how to start project, found out we were very underprepared and planned to meet a lot more
* Meeting 2 (Saturday Sep 28)
     - Met and mainly discussed the concepts of lab 2 and what we needed to apply to get a solution for our problem
     - I started creating my own file based off lab 2 to better understand DEAP and give my group a better foundation to look at
* Meeting 3 (Monday Sep 30)
     - Met and went over what we had all learned so far, had issues creating codominant functions and graphs to display AUC over time.
* Meeting 4 (Tuesday Oct 1)
     - Met with TA in computer lab to get a more one on one teaching session since we were still confused as how to finish from where we were.


* Personal Contribution:
      - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uaTbEu9CVNxPHf5q6RBBTnqksuH6GoNR
      Created a less reliable version than our final but it was a good building point.
      Used these resources along with Lab 2 to help.
