* Use batch feeding to solve our isssues with 
* conv2d primitives take a very long time to run

== February 18, 2019 ==

==== '''Team Meeting notes:''' ====
* Run main.py successfully
* change our fitness function to something more reliable.
* make batch size a hyperparameter, to deal with the conv2d issue.

==== '''Team Meeting Notes''' ====
* Running ezCGP for multiple generations gave rise to errors due to excessive GPU memory usage.
* On monitoring memory usage, it was found that deepcopying individuals before mutation resulted in a large usage of memory that didn't decrease much over time.
* It was found that each individual appeared to have a copy of the data that kept getting deepcopied along with the rest of the variables. 
** This memory bloat was mitigated by clearing the individuals copy of the data before exiting the evaluation method. 
* The whole evolutionary process can now be run for multiple generations without excessive memory usage. 

==== '''Generation wide storage of individuals and visualisations of statistics''' ====
* Jinghua updated the code so that individuals are saved across the multiple generations. 
* Furthermore, she added a file result_analysis.py which reads these stored individuals, and visualizes certain statistics (accuracy and number of active nodes) related to them.
* This will prove useful when it comes to visualising statistics across the generations  for presentation and debugging purposes. 

== Sunday,  March 10, 2019, Individual Work ==

==== '''Ran on MNIST'' ====
* Ran the code on MNIST, got everything working with tf-gpu on linux
* Wrote a dockerfile (adapted from TFs dockerfiles repo) to run cuda on linux 
** https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/blob/tensorflow-nn/Dockerfile
* cuda is a pain, just use docker


== Monday, March 11, 2019, Team meeting ==

==== '''Team Meeting Notes:''' ====

* no meeting, 3 hr presentation day

== Thursday, March 14, 2019, Sub-team meeting ==

==== '''Team Meeting Notes:''' ====
* decided to split team
** work on ezcgp development, make it easier for outside use
*** live up to the name
** work on making it better at deep learning
*** regression?
