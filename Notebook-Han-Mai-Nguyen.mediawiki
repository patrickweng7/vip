* '''Lab 2 Part 2 Result'''
After wandering around with fuctions I choose to get the result of trial 3 since it generates the best results combination:

<code>toolbox.register("mutate2", gp.mutNodeReplacement, pset=pset)</code>

* '''Meeting with Professor Zutty:'''

Met with Professor Zutty virtually to to catch up on Lab 1 and Genetic Algorithms.
* '''Lab 2 Part 1 Result'''
''Trial 1:''

<code>toolbox.register("mutate2", gp.mutInsert, pset=pset)</code>

Inserts a new branch at a random position in ''individual''. The subtree at the chosen position is used as child node of the created subtree, in that way, it is really an insertion rather than a replacement. Note that the original subtree will become one of the children of the new primitive inserted, but not perforce the first (its position is randomly selected if the new primitive has more than one child).

''Trial 2:''

<code>toolbox.register("mutate2", gp.mutShrink, pset=pset)</code>

Inserts a new branch at a random position in ''individual''. The subtree at the chosen position is used as child node of the created subtree, in that way, it is really an insertion rather than a replacement. Note that the original subtree will become one of the children of the new primitive inserted, but not perforce the first (its position is randomly selected if the new primitive has more than one child).

''Trail 3:''

<code>toolbox.register("mutate2", gp.mutNodeReplacement, pset=pset)</code>

Replaces a randomly chosen primitive from ''individual'' by a randomly chosen primitive with the same number of arguments from the <code>pset</code> attribute of the individual.
