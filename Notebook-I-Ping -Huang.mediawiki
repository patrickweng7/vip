'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Grid Engine is bugged and does not work, cannot work on the new issues since this one is blocking needs to ask Jason how its needed
* We worked on solving the new docker dependencies issues, need to inform the team that the old docker file is VERY bugged
'''Cache Sub-Team Notes:'''
* Reminded each other to document the changes we have made
* ...Which includes fixing the Dockerfile for dependency conflicts and qsub/slurm not working (used in launchGTMOEP as the computing cluster code)

* Ask Jason about how to configure the slurm.conf file, and how it is normally done on the GT clusters
* Also ask Jason whether slurm or grid engine are necessary, and whether we should include it as in the image as a dependency

* The merged files should be bug free, get Ben to check my merged code and his merged code

* Talked about slurm and decided to not pursue the development of slurm along with emade (since we don't need it at this point for emade)
* Decided to start some benchmarking instead
'''Cache Sub-Team Notes:'''
* We ran launchGTMOEP together and debugged a lot of configurations, it was able to run emade/cache properly
