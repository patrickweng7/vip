=== Team Notes ===

==== Scrum Meeting ====
* Sub teams present their findings from the entire semester
* Stock, Caching, Data Visualization, and Deep Learning
* Notes - collaborative for team
** First group, Stocks
*** Use EMADE to predict stock prices based on historical data
*** Regression problem instead of classification (?)
*** Implemented technical indicators as feature construction
*** Since it's regression instead of classification, implemented completely different primitives (ex: MDP)
*** Data used: Text file of GE stock data with some preprocessing
*** Time series decomposed into multiple features (trend, seasonality, residuals)
*** These preprocessing methods have been Implemented into primitives for emade to work with
*** Statistical Models used: SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), VARMA (Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average), HWES (Holt-Winters Exponential Soothing)
*** Deep Learning Models used: MLP, RNN, LSTM
*** Accuracy metrics used to evaluate models: sMAPE (symmetric Mean Absolute Percent Error), MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)
*** Results: Statistical models have lower error than DL models, likely due to Statistical models fitting directly on testing data
*** DL methods also require much tuning
*** Results don't produce accurate enough results to use in real life
*** Problems
**** Emade timeout errors, workflow of Emade, unfamiliarity with implementation
*** Future work: run EMADE, more DL models, Sector market indicators
** Second group, Caching
*** Divided into multiple sub-teams
**** support all data types that EMADE supports
**** Create APIs that give users options to use their own cache invalidation method for their own problem space
*** Cache Maintenance - add documentation
**** Dockerizing Cache - simplify, standardize process of running on all OS's - makes updates easier, less work for GCP setup
**** Future updates: standardize outputs, build faster, fix conda version problems, test on other OS's
*** Cache Validation
**** Want more optimal system to maximize benefit of subtrees stored
**** Solution: use the Dynamic Programming solution to the Knapsack Problem
**** Problems with solution: time ineffective, time cost is large even when the number of subtrees in cache is very small
**** Potential solutions to those problems: Scale weights, benchmarking, using buckets, etc
*** Potential optimization of Knapsack
**** Performance vs precision tradeoff
***** Sacrifice precision with approximation algorithm, greedy, scaling & rounding
**** Parallelism
***** Hypercubes vs irregular mesh
*** Scripts/ work done
**** Wrote a script to run EMADE automatically
** Third group - EEG(us)
*** https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UBfFPGBJ5NM3D_9h8j1SWma7n7bXaxWzh4zxxjiS9z8/edit?ts=5cbe4470
** Fourth group, Data Visualization
*** Motivations
**** Provide a visual interface to be able to interact with EMADE
*** Recap Fall 2018
*** Goals for 2019
**** More visualizations
***** Visualizations of pareto front over time
**** Improve usability
**** Refactor Code
**** Make app generalize
**** Visualization of parents: concept
***** Want to have a visualization for where the parent of a dominated from comes from in a front.
*** User Study Feedback
**** documentation
***** Clearly state he separation between EMADE and EMADE-visualization
***** more detail on creating an environment
**** UI Feedback
**** Visualization
**** XML Importing
***** Goal:
****** Generalize visualizations for any type of problem and any kind of objective functions
*** Pickling First Years
**** Goal Reduce the number of times we make a call to the database in order to increase efficiency
***** Pickling
*** Future
**** Make EMADE log meta data in mysql table
**** finish hierarchy visualizations
**** add seed creation GUI
**** GUI for executing sql queries
** Fifth group, DEEP
*** Subteam B:
**** Regression Problem Housing Prices
**** Progress since Midterm
***** identified Kaggle Housing Price dataset
***** incorporated changes into ezCGP to support regression problems
***** Added Average Percent Change (APC) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as fitness functions for regression problem
***** used StandardScaler to split and normalize training/testing data and preprocessed the housing dataset
**** Housing Price Dateset:
**** Parameter Choices
***** restricted primitives to only dense layers, finding optimal number of dense layers
**** Individual with Best APC:
***** uses about 7 dense layers, 6 hidden
***** predicted price is just 1 value, housing price
***** trained best individual for 35 epochs
**** Results on Housing Dataset
***** compared to other kaggle results
***** regularized NN performed slightly better
*** Subteam A:
**** Improving structure of ezCGP
**** Progress since Midterm
***** implemented argument/parameter mutation
***** changed the framework to deal with large datasets
**** Dataset 1: MNIST
***** used because it is easy to evaluate and accessible, population size was 12, epoch set at 1, ran 35 generations
***** Results on MNIST
****** best individual is 95.85% and 98.84%
****** took the individual and trained on full training set
****** got 99.85%
***** Compare to Midterm Results
****** trained model further, about 42 epochs. best accuracy 99.43%
****** assume since its continuously increasing, will keep going up
**** Dataset 2- CIFAR-10
***** Parameters:
****** pop size 9, epochs to 3, 25 generations
***** Results on CIFAR-10:
****** best accuracy of 79.7%, ran for 100 epochs, increased in accuracy by 1.32%
**** Dataset 3- CIFAR -100
***** Parameters:
****** pop size 9, 5 epochs, 50 generations
***** Results:
****** low accuracy but still improved
****** best individual was bad - just a conv block->max pooling->average pooling
****** trained over 200 epochs because accuracy plateaued
****** cifar-100 model under performed when trained on whole dataset. why?
******* lack of genetic diversity
******* smaller models learn faster
******* larger models learn more defining features and therefore generalize better
****** how to fix?
******* increase number of epochs
******* utilize first and second order gradient information to make better judgement whether its done learning
******* kill smaller individuals

==== Team Meeting ====
* Jas/Ali--frequency band calculation for most common bands (he already made this in a Jupyter notebook, but he needs to put it into EMADE). 
* Joel/Rahul--refactor any organizational things you want (because I actually think you, Rahul, would also enjoy more software-engineering type tasks?). 
* James/Austin need to implement something from a paper that correlates with motor activity--James knows lots about neurosci to find something (or collaborate with me/Dr. Borich) and Austin is plenty good at Python and has been on this project for a long time/should know emade)

Notes from paper
* TMS Evoked changes in brain-state dynamics quantified by using EEG Data
** TMS-EEG has been possible to show how activation induced on one hemisphere advances to the contralateral side 
** ''J''(''r'', ''t'') = ''J''p(''r'', ''t'') + ''J''v(''r'', ''t''), shows the current distribution in the brain is often expressed in two parts
*** Jp is the primary current desnity from bioelectric activation of neurons
*** Jv is the volume of the current density, passive ohmic current density driven by Jp 
** Data used
*** 16 TMS-EEG Datasets from their database (6 males and 4 females)
** Primitive potential
*** Mean State Shift
*** State Variance
* Follow up papers to look into
** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1711458
** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6153960

==== Scrum Meeting ====
* Current Goals
** Review new data set from the brain-computer interface dataset 
** Analyze EEG band data, using that to create new features
** Run Emade on flattened data (both on samples and channel)
* Need to begin presentation for new members to join our EEG sub team 
* Found that no data was able to be collected from the data collection attempt Sunday. 
** Applying the EEG cap was very difficult even after configuration
** Hair is a potential issue 

==== Team Meeting ====
* Found a decent paper with a potential Dataset
** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635036/ 
** The paper was a good observation of using TMS and EEG together to gain features
*** potential primitives

==== Scrum Meeting ====
* Consolidated work finished on Sunday meeting regarding Morlet Wavelets and FORCE Cluster 
* Worked with Dr. Rohling regarding different wavelets in the SciPy documentation. 
** Need to figure out more regarding the implementation of these wavelets 
** Need to talk to Scott with adding more wavelets as primitives 

* Had a great discussion regarding primitives and avoiding adding a FFT requirement for the Morlet
** Because of the limitations, science research has towards trying everything, EMADE creates a perfect opportunity to explore different possbilities and combinations of algorithms. 
** Creating a primitive that is independent was decided to be the best approach

==== Team Meeting ====
* Was forced out the room because I was sick :(
* Joel and Ali spoke regarding the data preprocessing. It was an interesting discussion of the logical implementation of the 3d sample structure
* Scott pivoted the implementation of what I'd be working on from primitives
** I'll  be looking up Neuroscience research "papers that demonstrate a correlation between EEG features and excitability as measured by TMS"
