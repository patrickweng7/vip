=== '''Team Meeting Notes:''' ===
It was very fun to see all the hard works from teams and learned a lot from the presentation. There is a link for non-conflict NLP [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sfyO-eB262HKiVnPvO8vDu_6n4wR-Q1RJrIfldWo810/edit?usp=sharing presentation]
* '''NLP'''
** NN Learner
**# Keras API
**# LayersLists into Keras model
** Evolutionary Neural AutoML vs Deep Learning
** improve on EMADE, applied more primitives
** Toxity Dataset
*** Data was sparse
*** Runs with new primitives had lower AUC
*** Both beat baseline hand-tuned network
** Test Classification
*** 8 succesful runs
* '''EZCGP'''
** New semester students
*** implement for seeding
*** VGG with dropout
*** similar primitives
** New Experiments with ExCGP
*** Data Augmentation
***# New samples from small dataset
***# gets more datapointsm network robust
***# EAMDE for augmentation
*** Transfer learning
***# Get pre-trained, retrain layer
** Experiment Results
*** GPU-multiprocessing - allows faster testing
***# Lots of performance analysis
***# Distributed GPU best, costs money

* '''Research Fundamental'''
** Got 8 runs on PACE 
*** Bloat metric quantifies change in hypervolume vs change or speciation based on topological similarity
*** Distance threshold
*** Neat baseline performance
=== '''Subteam Meeting Notes Notes:''' ===
* Final rehersal before presentation
* Check each of team member's assigned part

** EMADE(Evolutionary Multi Objective Algorithm Design Engine)  combines ML and dynamic programming to develop hybrid algorithms
** High level primitives (automate process of designing ML algorithms)
** XML template files are instructions for emade to run
** Vectorize data --> Take something that has multiple options and create separate columns for each one.
** Csv files are in datasets/titanic/
** .gz compresses data
** Need mysql server (use HomeBrew) , download and install git-lfs (large file storage, store in a separate location), clone EMADE repo, run setup module
** Checkout Help Desk tomorrow and Friday
** Python src/GPFramework/launchGTMOEP.py templates/input_titanic.xml
** Master manages the population (creates the new generation)
** Worker is for the parallel evaluation (assign the objective scores) '''Steps to Run EMADE:'''
** Detailed instructions in powerpoint slide and github readme file.
** Install git-lfs and checkout EMADE repo
** Download dependecy packages(using anaconda and pip) and mySQL server (use HomeBrew)
** mySQL version 5 is recommended
** Edit Input XML file (pythonConfig tag, database credentials)
** Reuse 0 gives you a fresh start, pick up where you left off use 1 '''Sub-team Notes:'''

* Introduction to VIP Notebook
* Automated Algorithm Design
** Part1 - Genetic Algoritm
*** new generation created through mating/mutation of individuals in previous population, will eventually produce the best individual
** Genetic Algorithm - Keywords
*** Individual : one candidate in population(with properties like DNA)
*** Selection : represents “survival of the fittest”, gives preference to better individuals, therefore allowing them to pass on their genes
**** Fitness Proportionate : the greater the fitness value, the higher probability of being selected for mating
**** Tournament : several tournaments among individuals, winners are selected for mating
*** Population : group of individuals, their properties will be altered
*** Mate / Crossover : represents mating between individuals
**** Single Point
**** Double Point
*** Mutate : introduces random modifications; purpose is to maintain diversity
*** Objective : value used to characterize individuals
*** Fitness : relative comparison to other individuals
*** Evaluate : function that computes the objective of an individual
*** Algorithms : various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual
