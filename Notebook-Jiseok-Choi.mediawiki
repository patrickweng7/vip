'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Final presentations and pizza
* Had to leave early due to conflict at 5:30 pm
'''Contributions/Final Grade:'''
* As the de facto team leader, while I do take responsibility for our group failing to produce any results, I still believe I deserve an A considering the amount of work put in.
* Originally it was my intention to have 2+ weeks to run EMADE, but it took too long for everything to be implemented, and not everyone contributed to the project.
* It felt difficult to delegate tasks properly and meet our goals each week, but perhaps that is just my fault as the leader.
* If possible, next semester, I would prefer working with a smaller group of reliable people.
