'''Presentation Notes:'''

* First group, Stocks
** Use EMADE to predict stock prices based on historical data
** Regression problem instead of classification (?)
** Implemented technical indicators as feature construction
** Since it's regression instead of classification, implemented completely different primitives (ex: MDP)
** Data used: Text file of GE stock data with some preprocessing
** Time series decomposed into multiple features (trend, seasonality, residuals)
** These preprocessing methods have been Implemented into primitives for emade to work with
** Statistical Models used: SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), VARMA (Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average), HWES (Holt-Winters Exponential Soothing)
** Deep Learning Models used: MLP, RNN, LSTM
** Accuracy metrics used to evaluate models: sMAPE (symmetric Mean Absolute Percent Error), MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)
** Results: Statistical models have lower error than DL models, likely due to Statistical models fitting directly on testing data
** DL methods also require much tuning
** Results don't produce accurate enough results to use in real life
** Problems
*** Emade timeout errors, workflow of Emade, unfamiliarity with implementation
** Future work: run EMADE, more DL models, Sector market indicators

**Second group, Caching
***Divided into multiple sub-teams
****support all data types that EMADE supports
****Create APIs that give users options to use their own cache invalidation method for their own problem space
***Cache Maintenance - add documentation
****Dockerizing Cache - simplify, standardize process of running on all OS's - makes updates easier, less work for GCP setup
****Future updates: standardize outputs, build faster, fix conda version problems, test on other OS's
***Cache Validation
****Want more optimal system to maximize benefit of subtrees stored
****Solution: use the Dynamic Programming solution to the Knapsack Problem
****Problems with solution: time ineffective, time cost is large even when the number of subtrees in cache is very small
****Potential solutions to those problems: Scale weights, benchmarking, using buckets, etc
***Potential optimization of Knapsack
****Performance vs precision tradeoff
*****Sacrifice precision with approximation algorithm, greedy, scaling & rounding
****Parallelism
*****Hypercubes vs irregular mesh
***Scripts/ work done
****Wrote a script to run EMADE automatically

**Third group - EEG(us)
***https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UBfFPGBJ5NM3D_9h8j1SWma7n7bXaxWzh4zxxjiS9z8/edit?ts=5cbe4470

**Fourth group, Data Visualization
***Motivations
****Provide a visual interface to be able to interact with EMADE
***Recap Fall 2018
***Goals for 2019
****More visualizations
*****Visualizations of pareto front over time
****Improve usability
****Refactor Code
****Make app generalize
****Visualization of parents: concept
*****Want to have a visualization for where the parent of a dominated from comes from in a front.
***User Study Feedback
****documentation
*****Clearly state he separation between EMADE and EMADE-visualization
*****more detail on creating an environment
****UI Feedback
****Visualization
****XML Importing
*****Goal:
******Generalize visualizations for any type of problem and any kind of objective functions
***Pickling First Years
****Goal Reduce the number of times we make a call to the database in order to increase efficiency
*****Pickling
***Future
****Make EMADE log meta data in mysql table
****finish hierarchy visualizations
****add seed creation GUI
****GUI for executing sql queries

**Fifth group, DEEP
***Subteam B:
****Regression Problem Housing Prices
****Progress since Midterm
*****identified Kaggle Housing Price dataset
*****incorporated changes into ezCGP to support regression problems
*****Added Average Percent Change (APC) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as fitness functions for regression problem
*****used StandardScaler to split and normalize training/testing data and preprocessed the housing dataset
****Housing Price Dateset:
****Parameter Choices
*****restricted primitives to only dense layers, finding optimal number of dense layers
****Individual with Best APC:
*****uses about 7 dense layers, 6 hidden
*****predicted price is just 1 value, housing price
*****trained best individual for 35 epochs
****Results on Housing Dataset
*****compared to other kaggle results
*****regularized NN performed slightly better
***Subteam A:
****Improving structure of ezCGP
****Progress since Midterm
*****implemented argument/parameter mutation
*****changed the framework to deal with large datasets
****Dataset 1: MNIST
*****used because it is easy to evaluate and accessible, population size was 12, epoch set at 1, ran 35 generations
*****Results on MNIST
******best individual is 95.85% and 98.84%
******took the individual and trained on full training set
******got 99.85%
*****Compare to Midterm Results
******trained model further, about 42 epochs. best accuracy 99.43%
******assume since its continuously increasing, will keep going up
****Dataset 2- CIFAR-10
*****Parameters:
******pop size 9, epochs to 3, 25 generations
*****Results on CIFAR-10:
******best accuracy of 79.7%, ran for 100 epochs, increased in accuracy by 1.32%
****Dataset 3- CIFAR -100
*****Parameters:
******pop size 9, 5 epochs, 50 generations
*****Results:
******low accuracy but still improved
******best individual was bad - just a conv block->max pooling->average pooling
******trained over 200 epochs because accuracy plateaued
******cifar-100 model under performed when trained on whole dataset. why?
*******lack of genetic diversity
*******smaller models learn faster
*******larger models learn more defining features and therefore generalize better
******how to fix?
*******increase number of epochs
*******utilize first and second order gradient information to make better judgement whether its done learning
*******kill smaller individuals

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Met up with James and (Kang is not here yet)
* Fixed the error in both primitives, Scott's python notebook runs fine, which means we will commence seeding on Monday
* Seeding and running emade will be done with the entire EEG team
* Decided to try to implement a new primitive before seeding: Butterworth filter, order 3

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Continued working on testing primitives
* Discussed with James about what to do on Sunday
* Had some trouble running Scott's python notebook
** The error was that the GPFramework import in the notebook was pulling from the original emade, not eegmade, because the names are the same
** Fixed error by bash reinstalling the eegmade repository
*Ran into some errors in the primitives that I could not fix in the meeting time - will have to work on it on Sunday
*Also want to meet with Kang once to discuss what he will be doing

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Learned more in depth about primitives and the EEG data
* When making primitives, need to watch for the mode that we are trying to achieve, such as Stream to Stream, Stream to Features, or Features to Features
* Image on right is a short recap of what we learned
* Got an idea of how to make the primitives I am trying to make from today's meeting
* MSS and SV are both Stream to Features, and will require fiddling with the EEG data that comes in the form of an array
* Will work with James, Shlok and Kang on Sunday to hopefully finish coding the primitives
* Scott also gave us a python notebook to test individual primitives: will do that once the primitives themselves have been finished

'''Presentation Notes:'''

Team Viz:
* Provide visual interface to be able to interact with EMADE
* Inspired from TensorBoard
* Goals for 2019: more visualizations, usability
Team 4:
* Approaches: Name, Ticket, Cabin Columns dropped
* Results: 0.79 accuracy using GP, better than ML approach
* Concluded that EMADE can make building deployable models much easier
* Side notes: messed up pareto front graph
Team 3:
* Approaches: all used different classifier, dropped non numerical non categorical columns, used GridSearch to find best parameters
* All members also used different preprocessing methods other than methods mentioned above
* Used EMADE with parameter reuse set to 1, mating: crossover, headless chicken, mutation: insert, insert modify, ephemeral, node replace, uniform, shrink
== February 17, 2019 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Scott taught us a more in depth explanation of FFT and possible transformations alongside it to increase accuracy
* Need to use the Morlet Wavelet or other methods to be able to extract more information from the EEG data.
* Decided to add some new primitives to Emade including InverseFFT (iFFT) and Morlet wavelet transformation
