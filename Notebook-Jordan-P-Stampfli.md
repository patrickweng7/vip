* Dr. Zutty went over the syllabus and presentation dates
* Dr. Zutty gave lecture 1

**Lecture 1**
* genetic algorithms
  * evolve generations through selective breeding to improve fitness and optimize solutions
  * individual: one person in population
  * population: group of all individuals
  * objective: performance metric (raw score)
  * fitness: relative performance (curved score)
  * evaluation: computes objective given an individual
  * selection: survival of the fittest
    * fitness proportionate: increase fitness, increase chance of selection
    * tournament: individuals pair off into groups and compare fitness to see who is selected
  * mate/crossover: splice genes
  * mutation: random modifications used to maintain diversity
* genetic algorithm formula
  * initialize population
  * evaluate population
  * loop
    * select parents
    * mate and mutate
    * evaluate new generation
