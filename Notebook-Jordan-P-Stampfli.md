*Dr. Zutty went over the syllabus and presentation dates

'''Lecture 1'''
* genetic algorithms
**evolve generations through selective breeding to improve fitness and optimize solutions
**individual: one person in population
**population: group of all individuals
**objective: performance metric (raw score)
**fitness: relative performance (curved score)
**evaluation: computes objective given an individual
**selection: survival of the fittest
***fitness proportionate: increase fitness, increase chance of selection
***tournament: individuals pair off into groups and compare fitness to see who is selected
**mate/crossover: splice genes
**mutation: random modifications used to maintain diversity
*genetic algorithm formula
**initialize population
**evaluate population
**loop
***select parents
***mate and mutate
***evaluate new generation
