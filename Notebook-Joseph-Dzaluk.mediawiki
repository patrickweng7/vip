=== Team Notes ===
* Final Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ve_3G6xkq_y0QRFFXv0Mv7hAi-348cVPt48Zessnv_s/edit#slide=id.gadbc172287_0_95

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
* Run from Monday, one of the individuals outperformed the rest 
** Bollinger bin gives three features then uses a decision tree
** Abhi tried recreating it with sci-kit learn 
** The CDF it got was .06, so it was a 6% chance that this individual was just doing random computation 
** The individual: Learner(MyBollingerBand(ARG0, 2, 61, falseBool), LearnerType('DECISIONTREE_REGRESSION', None), EnsembleType('SINGLE', None))
** We are finally getting 10+ individual outperforming our seeds
* What additional changes do we want to see done
** What change in variables change the results 
** Changing evolutionary variables 
** Changing crossover and mutation percentage 
** Changing the number of seeds we use 

=== Individual Notes ===
* Slide for Final Presentation focused around future focus: 
** 1. incorporate fundamental analysis which are measures that try to quantify a company’s underlying value and potential for future growth rather than its current and past market prices. some examples of fundamental analysis metrics are things like revenue, earnings, future growth, return on equity, and profit margins
** 2. We want to compare the effectiveness and differing profit percentages on different time scales such as hourly / daily / weekly 
** 3. We want to incorporate a different paper which transforms price and TIs into image data

=== Team Notes ===
* Our Final Presentations are on April 30th at 6pm
* Peer evals due Tuesday April 27th

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
* Discussed changing the how many and quality of seeds
* Or potentially having more datasets, longer timeframe
* New Fibonacci retracement, Ichimoku Kinkō Hyō
* RSI debug, any length of data now, default parameters on MACD

* We did 10 get runs of EMADE to see if we train an individual on just apple data if it performs better on one stock than other stocks, seems not that much better
* Seems like the results are pretty correlated throughout different stocks 
* Adding another data set to our EMADE run, we wanted maybe longer-term flatter return stock outside of tech, maybe consumer staple

=== Individual Notes ===
* Helping implement new TI’s David sent
* Stochastic RSI: Better for choppier, neutral trends
* Aroon: Time vs Price, helpful for trend spotting and can also be used to identify consolidations. Could be used in downtrends where smaller reversals are tough to spot
* VWAP: Volume indicator that takes into account of both price and volume. Good for spotting entry and exit points for intraday trading.

=== Team Notes ===
* 7 new members:
** Diptendu
** Pranav
** Sriram
** David W.
** Coleman
** Devesh
** Dhruv
* Presented to new members to catch them up with the paper and our setup

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
* Monte Carlo simulation would not have to be restimulated for every new individual 
** We could instead use a look-up table to compare the individual's metrics to the distribution
* Our initial Monte Carlo test took a set of 100 days where using a probability given from an input there would be random indices chosen and we would simply buy and sell back and forth for each index 
* That would give us a profit percentage distribution to compare new individuals to
** After seeing this run Max noted that our past "best" individual actually scored very well 

* Next EMADE run: 
** New TA-lib primitives
** New evaluation metrics: 
*** Average Profit per Transactions
*** Variance of Profit per Transaction

=== Individual Notes ===
* Research on Monte Carlo Simulations relating to investing:

* Basic understanding of Monte Carlo Simulations and how it can be applied in investing: 
** https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp
* Article detailing Python implementaion and how drift and volatility work:
** https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/monte-carlo-simulations-for-predicting-stock-prices-python-a64f53585662
*** Drift: Direction that rates of returns have had in the past
*** Volatility: Historical volatility multiplied by a random

=== Team Notes ===
* Presentation Day: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xvS6nfHNZ9N56m4cDXoD4KzHeRoKkhfhsfIDHpysOUE/edit#slide=id.p

* Stocks: 
** Presentation went well
** Feedback: Normalize the profit percentage, Monte Carlo simulation may be a way to calculate this
** Need a way to measure individuals better than random 
** Jason would like to see more analysis of each of our individuals 

* ezCGP:
** They have problems with overfitting 

* Modularity:
** Don't know how to incentivize ARL generation, may try to use different selection methods

* NLP:
** Using PACE-ICE
** After an un-seeded run they did not get good results
** Potential switch from Keras to Pytorch


=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
* Had a lengthy discussion about Monte Carlo possibilities
** One idea is to simply compare against buy and hold for the same time duration
*** Pro's: Simple, standard, repeatable
*** Con's: May not yield as accurate of results as Monte Carlo 
** Max and I will investigate possibilities of Monte Carlo sim

* Other ideas surrounding fitness functions:
** Profit per trade, PPT = profit percentage divided by the number of transactions
*** We debated if this was even necessary as both profit percentage itself may be a more valuable objective as placing value on increasing or decreasing the number of trades isn't necessarily important 
** We did consider lowering variance of profit a valid objective as providing more a more repeatable and consistent algorithm compared to an algorithm that was less consistent but yielded the same total profit percentage over a longer period of time  


=== Individual Notes ===
* My slide is a high-level overview discussing our objectives and methods:
* Objectives: 
** How can we use TI’s to predict specific stock trends and generate buy/sell signals?
** How can we use EMADE to optimize market existing trading algorithms?
* Methods
** Find literature on stock prediction using TI’s, ML, and Genetic Programming
** Learn about technical indicators and establish which ones might be useful to us
** Recreate a trading algorithm using our literature as a basis
** Use EMADE to optimize our trading algorithms cited in published papers

* We completed an initial run but numerous individuals were not valid because they were in the wrong mode so we could not analyze the results
* From there we completed a second run without the mode problem and with profit percentage among other additional metrics such as tree size and average mean absolute error 
* These yielded positive results

=== Team Notes ===
* Notebooks are due next Thursday and Peer Evaluations are due next Friday

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
* Progress is going well:
** Abhi and Kartik worked on why our trading signals have flat segments 
** Abhi and Davis learned more about exponential smoothing and may have a working implementation
** Max is looking into a TI library which may save us some time as well as add diversity to our primitives
** Rishi found new stock data from AlphaVantage which is much closer to the data in the paper
** We are thinking of simply maximizing a lot of random iterations to find optimal threshold as opposed to how the paper uses GP
* Short Term Goals:
** Finalize PLR method
** Label all 6 datasets
** Determine a method for finding optimal threshold 
** Integrate Exponential Smoothing in EMADE as a fitness function
** Finalize / prepare datasets for EMADE runs

=== Individual Notes ===
*Worked on three volume-based TI's (the ones I previously researched)
*[[files/Screen Shot 2021-03-04 at 10.14.37 PM.png|none|thumb|477x477px|VROC Primitive]][[files/Screen Shot 2021-03-04 at 9.00.55 PM.png|none|thumb|457x457px|OBV Primitive]][[files/Screen Shot 2021-03-04 at 9.01.47 PM.png|none|thumb|441x441px|CO Primitive]]
*The Chaikin Oscillator can not be fully written until parameters are changed in the dataset 
*Specifically volume within a day is an important metric and necesarry for determing moving averages

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
* After talking to Dr. Zutty people explained how he said that there are two ways to go about dealing with data:
** First choice is creating individual Monte Carlo folds per stock which will test the pipeline
** The second choice is to lump all stock data together and create random folds for the entire dataset. This would result in a broader model which would likely be more generalizable to other datasets
* Generally we are leaning towards the first choice so we can make the most effective trade decisions on a specific stock and then create the best possible pipeline
* Abhi went into further detail about changes he made over Winter Break 
* Shorter meeting, we need to get work done on the TI's and getting a successful run of PLR method

=== Individual Notes ===
* I noticed for Chaikin Oscillator we need a way to see volume within a day which is not yet accessible so I need to work on importing different data

=== Team Notes ===
* Our meeting with Jason was cancelled, but we were able to ask some questions that may be helpful moving forward
** We asked about the new paper and our general direction
** As well as how to create structured trees in EMADE where we can change hyperparameters of the functions themselves as opposed to the technical indicators and learners

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
*Abhi was explaining how he simplified EMADE primitives what reduced the number of individuals that would not compile by only allowing EMADE to yse primitives that were related to TI's or regression learners
*Decided on a final paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494611000937
** The paper uses a piecewise linear regression to create labels in the data 
** The PLR used a moving window which was found through Genetic Programming but specifics aren't detailed in the paper
** A neural network predicts when a stock will change direction based off the labeling so instead of using classification they use regression for confidence 
* Then there is a dynamic threshold that decides when to buy or sell if the price is extreme enough in some direction (similar to the GP I don't fully understand this but it seems they are using exponential moving averages)
* This paper seems like a good inspiration since every step was optimized once at a time and EMADE may be able to improve each step

=== Individual Notes ===
* Paper I proposed to be a loose inspiration for this semester:
** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705114001403
** Uses multitree genetic programming to create a dynamic portfolio
* I noticed we were a little light on volume TI's:
** On-Balance Volume:
*** Leading Indicator
*** If the price is higher than previous for give a time period then we add the given volume level, if the price is lower we subtract the given volume level
**Chaikin Oscillator:
*** Leading Indicator
*** Measures the accumulation-distribution line of moving average convergence-divergence (MCAD)
*** This indicator really focuses in on the relationship between the number of buyers and sellers with a core belief that the relationship between the two (primarily the quantity) is what drives price
**Volume Rate of Change:
*** Lagging Indicator
*** To calculate this, you need to divide the volume change over the last n-periods (days, weeks or months) by the volume n-periods ago. The answer is a percentage change of the volume over the last n-periods.
*** A positive ROC will indicate increasing volume and vice-versa

* Came to the conclusions that our subteam meeting will be 5:30-6:15 on Thursdays and Max and I's meeting with Dr. Zutty will be afterwards from 6:15-

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
* As mentioned we are still looking for a paper that is similar to last semester but less restrictive 
* Our goals (both short and long term):
** Writing primitives (specifically in areas we feel we need more) 
** Experiment with new labeling methods 
** Adding fundamentals to see if EMADE can do analysis 
** Create a model that outperforms a paper
** Use it on numerous datasets and compare results

* Biggest take aways from presentation were:
** Label every axes
** Discuss the hyperparameters of each run
** Explain the equations / how each TI works on a deeper level 
** Give a better introduction to the paper we are attempting to replicate

* '''Neural Networks Team'''
** "Evolutionary Neural AutoML for Deep Learning"
*** Uses multi-objective evolution similar to this team
*** Attempted to Maximize AUROC and minimize number of parameters
** Keras was used for NN development
** Made progress on PACE as well as good documentation
** They created new primitives
*** CV primitives
** Run of Chest X-ray 
*** YOLO Nueral Networks are only fed each image once to make runs go faster
*** Went for 665 generations
**** Larger AUROC than the paper
** Hit a wall when a pareto individual from the first gen lasted the entire run
* '''ezCGP'''
** Reworked OpenCV preprocessing primitives
** Maximizing precision over accuracy 
** Used PACE-ICE GPU
** Genome seeding
** CIFAR10 run
*** Only 20 individuals per gen
*** 9 Generations over 50+ hours
*** 99.7% accuracy on CIFAR10
** Transitioning to MNIST dataset
* '''Modularity Team'''
** ARL implementation
*** It searches for common tree subsets which are then turned into primitives
*** Wanna try different ways of selecting ARLs
*** Differential Fitness
**** There was no statistical significance for helping fitness 
*** Alternate Selection
**** There was no statistical significance for helping fitness 
*** Data Pair Restriction
**** Interesting because they only allow subtrees that return EMADE data pairs but there was no statistical significance for helping fitness 
*** Alternate Selection with Data Pair Restriction
**** There was no statistical significance for helping fitness 

=== Individual Notes ===
* Anshul and I met up and reworked our OBV method[[files/New OBV.png|none|thumb|565x565px]]
* Unit test has yet to be created but there was still internal dialogue as to which TIs we wish to use going forward
* May need to try some experimentation with each next semester
* Slide I will be presenting on[[files/Final presentation slide.png|none|thumb|480x480px]]
* Will discuss how volume is an important metric as it allows us to pick stocks that are likely to have strong trends
** Additionally high volume means you can exit and enter positions with much more fludity which is important if we wnated to actually trade

* Create my slide 
[[files/MidtermSlide.png|none|thumb]]
* Planning on talking about how before any sort of implementation we aimed to understand trend analysis itself to the best of our abilities
* That started with asking some important questions:
** Regression vs Classification 
*** Regression to predict the price of stock and then decide to buy or sell
** Which Stock Tickers?
*** Diverse (so our results are not purely determined by one sector), high volume (would give us theoretical power to buy/sell when needed), stable stocks (a lower volatility)
** Which Technical Indicators?
*** A technical indicator is a sort of heuristic used by traders to determine entry or exit points in a trade.  They all have different formulas but they only take in the price, volume and open interest of aecurity and return  In the top right is an example of a volume technical indicator called “On-Balance-Volume,” it is a leading indicator meaning it is used to try to predict a trend rather than following one

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
*We had a discussion regarding CEFLANN and how it operates
**“In comparison to other soft computing techniques, functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) and Legendre Neural Network (LeNN) has less computational cost and is easily implemented in hardware applications. This is the motivation on which the present research work is based.”
**https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6508166
***The MLP takes 100 times longer to simulate compared to FLANN
*CEFLANN implementation in EMADE seems possible

* We have decided to focus on one specific paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405918815300179?via%3Dihub
* Discussing how much we want to deviate from the paper:
** Do we change the data set?
** Do we change TIs?
** Do we want a similar architecture?

=== Individual Notes ===
*Picked two research papers to do extensive reading
*https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920317877
**Stock Market prediction on High frequency data using Long-Short Term Memory
***Used Deep Learning
*** Regression “Long-Short Term Memory” model
*** Technical Indicators: Open, High, Low, Close prices, Volume, EMA12, EMA25, MACD, BollingerUp and Bollinger Down
*** Concluded technical indicators did not improve the results of their existing models
*** When not using technical indicators they simply used Open, High, Low, Close prices and Volume values as input

* https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/52104888.pdf
** Predicting Stock Prices Using Technical Analysis and Machine Learning
*** Performed on Oslo Stock Exchange
*** [[files/Agents.png|none|thumb]]
*** “We consequently apply Occam’s razor to the choice of technical indicators, leaving out the intricate price patterns and focusing on the most popular indicators that can be efficiently operationalized and that are relatively objective in interpretation.”
*** Two layer reasoning architecture: Agent oriented design of first layer allows for easy integration with new analysis techniques. The second layer of reasoning is also easily adaptable because the ADTL algorithm’s fitness function can easily add additional constraints or you can change the measures of success.
*** Outperformed Oslo Benchmark Index (OSEBX)

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
* My subgroup (Research) will be meeting at 5:30 pm on Thursdays
* TI research team has been terminated
* We are continually looking at TI as well as different ways to implement ML (regression vs classification)
** Notes from talking with Jason:
*** STREAM_TO_FEATURE: Step detection might be a feature. (Eg) TI predicts a value could be a feature. Binary 01 could be a feature. Could be grouped differently.
*** STREAM_TO_STREAM: Time series data itself is manipulated. Mean filtering, median filtering, edge and step detection.
*** Seed things: algorithms that you expect to work feed into emade in the beginning so it’ll evolve from them.
*** How can automated algorithm design improve existing algorithms? 
**** Implement their algorithm in EMADE, feed data, add more indicators and see how it compares to the original.
*** Big goal: Find the best algorithm, but also find the algorithm that finds the best algorithm (how can the same program find a solution to a different problem?)
** Our model:
*** First model: confidence interval and price change percentage.
*** Second function: use the confidence interval, price change percentage to include in the fitness function to decide buy/sell/hold.
** Goals for next meeting:
*** Research group: 
**** Finish research into technical indicators, but then consider focusing more on looking at articles and research papers for building trading AIs, replicating those in EMADE, and then improving upon those methodologies with our own research

=== Individual Notes / Research ===
* Volume:
** On Balance Volume: <nowiki>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp</nowiki>
*** Leading Indicator
*** If the price is higher than the previous for given time period then we add the given volume level, if the price is lower we subtract the given volume level
*** [[files/OBV Formula.png|none|thumb]]
*** Not just a volume but also targets momentum; Recursive
*** Could be implemented hour by hour and day to day.
*** Limitations include the probability of it producing a false signal as well as the fact that a large spike in volume from an event such as a surprise earnings report or introduced to a new index can through off the metric
** Chaikin Oscillator: <nowiki>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chaikinoscillator.asp</nowiki>
*** Leading Indicator
*** Measures the accumulation-distribution line of moving average convergence-divergence (MCAD)
*** [[files/Chaikin Oscillator Formula.png|none|thumb]]
*** This indicator really focuses in on the relationship between the number of buyers and sellers with a core belief that the relationship between the two (primarily the quantity) is what drives the price
*** We use the indicator by watching for divergence when the center-line crosses over above the accumulation-distribution line. A positive divergence signals a stock price is likely to rise, given the increase in accumulation. A negative divergence signals a stock price is likely to fall, given the increase in distribution.
** Volume Rate of Change: <nowiki>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/091002.asp</nowiki>
*** To calculate this, you need to divide the volume change over the last n-periods (days, weeks or months) by the volume n-periods ago. The answer is a percentage change of the volume over the last n-periods.
*** A positive ROC will indicate increasing volume and vice-versa
*** It’s a lagging indicator so it is less likely to be predictive but at the same time it allows for the user to hop on an existing or established trend or confirm intuitions

* Some things we concluded
** EMADE takes a lot longer to create multiple generations that lower the AUC over time, however cit an be more effective at optimization.
** Different approaches give different results based on the level of processing.
* We explained the difficulties we ran into but ultimately reached results similar to the rest of the class

=== '''Personal Notes''' ===
* I am heavily leaning towards joined NLP subteam

=== '''Overview''' ===
* Our original Pareto front was in 2 dimensions even though we had 3 objectives, we realized this did not make sense
* We created a function to graph our Pareto front in 3 Dimensions as shown below
[[files/3Dimensional Pareto Front.png|center|thumb|Our 3 Dimensional Pareto Front]]
* Seen below is the AUC Comparison using ML, MOGP, and EMADE, the AUC's were .27 and .23 for the last two methods respectively[[files/Three Different Approaches.png|center|thumb|400x400px|AUC Comparison]]

=== '''Personal Notes''' ===

* Learning how to implement MySQL database

=== '''Meeting Notes''' ===
* Evolutionary Multi-Objective Algorithm Design Engine (EMADE)
* Learned how to run EMADE
* For EMADE datasets:
** It comes in CSV files
** A row is an instance, a column is a feature and final columns have truth data
* Main objectives:
** Weights - Should be minimized (-1.0) or maximized (1.0)
** Evaluation function specifies the name of a method 
** <workersPerHost> to see how many evaluations to run in parallel.
* We were also introduced to MYSQL

=== '''Overview''' ===
* The biggest take away:
** Learned that simply using MuPlusLambda was not one of the purposes of the project
** We should have created our own evolutionary loop
*Other takeaways:
**We should have added (1, 0) and (0, 1) to the graph as the boundaries avoid getting areas of zero
**We could have added additionally visual data such as the video movie of AUC progression
**We could have shown a specific individual function and its tree representation
**We could have used logical operators such as less than and greater than 

=== '''Personal Notes''' ===
* Felt presentation went well
* Next time / in the future attempt to create our own genetic algorithm for selection
* I will continue to mess around with inputs to try to decrease AUC on my own time

== September 25th, 2019, Wednesday ==

=== '''General Information''' ===
* Make sure to finish Peer Evaluations by next Friday 4 pm 
* We are now shifting to using genetic programming to solve similar problems

=== '''Meeting Notes''' ===
* We will now use multi-objective genetic programming to solve the same Titanic Problem
** For this, we are once again creating codominant individuals
** This time they will be genetically produced
** Must have 100 final individuals plotted on a Pareto front for FPR and FNR
** This is a minimization problem since we want to minimize FPR and FNR
** Therefore the smaller the area under the curve the better the set of individuals
** To create our individuals we will use simple primitives -, +, -, /, and, or, not, etc.
** They will evolve generation by generation in an evolutionary loop
** The final area under the curve of the 100 individuals will be our score

=== '''Sub-Team Notes''' ===
* Met with sub-team three times to complete project
* We decided to work on just one notebook since the final set of functions will evolve from one original set of functions
* We used the same feature set as last week’s assignment (PClass, Age, Sex, SibSp, Parch, Fare)
* Our Solution Code: https://github.gatech.edu/pagarwal80/VIP_AAD_subteam1/blob/master/Titanic_GP.ipynb
* Our team presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nOBkBBZlXKNpkpiklO-IvuAoEmPrEtOjIKG4s5BieRw/edit#slide=id.p

=== '''Overview / Personal Responsibilities''' ===
* '''Personal Tasks:'''[[files/Screen Shot 2019-10-04 at 3.44.45 PM.png|thumb|Primitives we chose to use]]
** I was assigned to find and implement a selection function 
** I figured out that selection Tournament would be a poor choice
*** This is because it is a single objective function and will only look at the first value
**Instead, I chose NSGA-II (Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) 
***Since it is multi-objective, we could minimize FPR and FNR
** Helped choose primitives with the rest of the team
** Helped find and implement MuPlusLambda 
*** It selected the best functions between both the current and parent generation
* [[files/Screen Shot 2019-10-04 at 3.52.55 PM.png|thumb|300x300px|Our final graph of the area under the curve over generations]]'''Project Conclusions:'''
** Each function plots to an FPR and FNR, we had 157 total codominant functions
** Our Area Under the Curve decreased over generations from 0.37 to 0.1183 over 150 generations. 
** We decided to stop at 150 because the difference started to vary by a factor of 10^-4

=== '''Overview''' ===
* Our team discussed after all the presentations about where we misunderstood the assignment
* We went back and added a Pareto front
* After further internal discussion, we reached an understanding amongst us all over the purpose of the assignment
* It was not to create 5 good functions, rather 5 functions which did not dominate each other and accomplished different things in relation to FPR and FNR

=== '''Personal Notes''' ===
* To better understand actual implementation of evolutionary functions I want to independently research more
* For that, I used: https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/api/tools.html
* Learned about one-point vs two-point crossover, different selection methods such as select random vs select best, looked into mutation functions such as mutFlipBit

== September 11th, 2019, Wednesday ==

=== '''General Information''' ===
* Were assigned to sub-team: [[Bootcamp Sub-team Fall 2019|Bootcamp Sub-Team Fall 2019]] (Team 1)
* My team consists of Aryender, Pulak, Anshul, Joseph (Me), Peiqi, Ford
* We will use Kaggle for our next project
* Scikit is a useful resource for searching for machine learning algorithms

=== '''Meeting Notes''' ===
*Discussed scikit-learn and different methods to tackle problems
*Ran notebook to create data and graphs
*Were assigned to sub-team and given our first project
*Each team was tasked with finding 5 co-dominant functions for predicting survivorship of the Titanic
*Must be plotted on FPR and FNR axis (minimization problem)
*Codominance:
**When functions are not dominated by each other
**For MOGP, they can differ/dominate each other in one input, but then the other function dominates the other in the other input
**There is a tradeoff from switching to one to another
**A set of codominant functions create a Pareto front

=== '''Personal Notes''' ===
Introductory Python Course:
* Finished the Python online course
* Learned everything I wanted to know
* Will later search for a new course to learn more data science skills
* For now, I will focus on projects within VIP
Titanic Presentation
* Could have gone better
* We misunderstood the purpose of the assignment originally
* Only two final functions were co-dominant and optimal and those two functions dominated the other three function
* Need to work on communication in further projects so we have a better understanding as a team

* Sub-Teams Defined:
** ADF (Automatically defined functions)
** Research Fundamentals

=== '''Meeting Notes''' ===
'''Multi-Objective Programming'''
* What type of things would we want in an algorithm?
** Minimize errors
** Low memory usage
** Efficient
** Secure
** Good false positive and false negative rate
** Usability (Interface)
** Cost-Effectiveness

* A gene pool is a set of genomes will get tested for fitness
** Genome: Genotypic description of an individual
** Phenotype: Phenotypic expression of an individual 
** Search Space: The set of all possible genomes

* Ways to score functions
** True Positive (TP) - The number of actual positives which are correctly identified (identified positive, actually positive)
** False Positive (FP) - The number of actual negatives which are incorrectly identified (identified positive, actually negative)
* Maximization  - We want to maximize the true measures (the ones that were correctly identified)
** Sensitive / True Positive Rate (TPR)
*** TRP = TP / (TP + FN)
** Specificity / True Negative Rate (TNR)
*** TNR = TN / (TN + FP)
* Minimization - We want to minimize the false measures (the ones that were incorrectly identified)
** False Negative Rate (FNR)
*** FNR = FN / P = FN / (TP + FN) = 1 - TPR
** False Positive Rate (FPR)
*** FPR = FP / N = FP / (TN + FP) = 1 - TNR
* Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (P + N) = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) (We would like to maximize accuracy)
* Genotype - DNA
* Phenotype - The manifestation of the function

[[files/Screen Shot 2019-10-04 at 2.06.18 AM.png|thumb|400x400px|The final co-dominant frontier of Pareto optimal individual functions by tree size and mean-squared error]]
* Purpose: Create individuals which are Pareto optimal to each other in both mean squared error and size of tree 
* Steps to get to that purpose using Multi_objective Genetic Programming:
** Create individuals (functions) 
** Create a way to test their fitness 
** Define specific functions with toolbox 
** Create an evaluation function 
** Create the evolutionary process 
** Create statistical data and graphs to show our results 

* ''The lower the area under the curve the better the set of codominant individuals''

=== '''Personal Notes''' ===
Introductory Python Course:
* The course is still going well and I am learning new material
* This week I spent 90 minutes on the course which translated to 68% of the entire course
* I am on pace to complete the entire course in one more week

== August 28st, 2019, Wednesday ==

=== '''General Information''' ===
* Important Dates:
** October 21st, 2019 and December 2nd, 2019
*** Both are on Monday from 4:30-7:30 PM 
*** First meeting First Semester sub-teams report EMADE updates and results
*** The Second meeting consists of Final Presentation from each sub-team

=== '''Meeting Notes''' ===
'''Genetic Programming'''
* Genetic programming is different because the program is the genome itself, the functions are the genomes
* Tree-based genetic programming: Primitives are functions which are also the nodes of the tree (+, -, *, /, etc.)
* Terminals are leaf nodes aka the inputs or parameters for the functions
* A tree is converted to a lisp preordered parse tree
** If a function was f(x) = 5 - 6*2
** The parse tree would be [-, 5, *, 6, 2]

* Weakly typed- any kind of input can go into any slot
* Strongly types- this takes in certain types of data into what slots
* Mating and Mutation:
** Mating: It is a single-point crossover, we exchange subtrees, 
** Mutation: We mutate a single node, or add/ delete a subtree
'''Symbolic Regression'''
* Type of regression analysis
* Searches for function with the best fit of the data
* Using +, -, *, /, !, sin, cos, etc. help the evolution process

=== '''Overview''' ===
DEAP Lab 2 Part 1 - Single Symbolic Regression
* Purpose: The purpose is to use genetic programming to produce a function that minimizes the mean squared error between the created function and the actual function 
* As evolution occurred and fitness was tested, the mean-squared error between the two functions decreased
* The better individuals (functions) were surviving and continuing to mate and mutate as the worse functions died off

=== '''Personal Notes''' ===
Introductory Python Course:
* The course is going well and I am relearning concepts as I anticipated
* This week I spent 90 minutes on the course which translated to 35% of the entire course
* I am on pace to complete the entire course in two more weeks

== August 21st, 2019, Wednesday ==

=== '''General Information''' ===
* First 10 weeks new students meet at Klaus 1440 on Wednesdays from 4:30-5:20 PM
* Notebooks are essential for displaying all work, progress, and notes
** If it is not in the notebook, "Then you didn't do it"
* Grade Distribution is as follow:
** Documentation and records (33%)
** Personal accomplishments and contributions to your team’s goals (33%)
** Teamwork and interaction (33%)

=== '''Meeting Notes''' ===
'''Genetic Algorithm'''
* An approach to optimization problems that is based on natural selection.
* It tries to optimize the solution, or produce the best individual, the one that displays maximal fitness, by repetitively mating and mutating individuals of a given population based on chosen attributes, eventually leading to a single best individuals with optimal fitness, displaying the chosen attributes.
* Individual - A specific candidate in the population (can be characterized by DNA)
* Population - The set of all individuals
* Objective - A value to characterize the individuals which is either maximized or minimized
* Fitness - Relative objectiveness, for example, getting good grades is an objective but class rank would be fitness
* Evaluation - A function that computes fitness
* Selection- Individuals with higher fitness have a better chance of mating through higher selection (represents survival of the fittest)
** The two ways this can be conducted are:
**# Fitness Proportionate- The greater the fitness value the greater the probability of being selected for mating (not random)
**# Tournament: Several tournaments are held and winners are selected for mating (random)
* Mate/Crossover - Mating between individuals of the population where there are different ways to combine the genetic information of the two mates to create the offspring
* Mutate - Introduces random modifications to the individuals' makeup so that diversity is maintained
<u>General Process of the Genetic Algorithm:</u>
# Create a randomly initialized population
# Determine the overall fitness level of the population
# Choose select parents from the population with relatively high fitness
# Perform mating/crossover to produce the next generation population
# Perform mutation on the next generation to maintain diversity
# Continue to repeat steps 2-5 until the best individual of a given population displays maximal fitness (where that boundary lies must be set)

[[files/Screen Shot 2019-08-31 at 11.31.57 PM.png|thumb|My own mutation program which swaps two indexes of an individual (which in this instance translated to switching the location of two queens on a given chess board)]]

=== '''Overview''' ===
* DEAP Lab 1 Part 1 - One Max Problem
** Created individuals through a random initializer
** Algorithm ran for 40 generations
** Progress in fitness was tracked
** Tournament style selection took place where 50% mated and 20% mutated
** Fitness of new generation was analyzed 
** Process was repeated until the individual with the highest fitness was found
* DEAP Lab 1 Part 2 - N Queens Problem
** An 8x8 chessboard contains 8 queens
** The chessboard is the individual 
** The individual's fitness level is determined by the number of interactions between all the queens
** Fitness was tracked
** Crossover/Mutation occurred
** Offspring were produced 
** Process was repeated until the individual with the best/lowest fitness was found

=== '''Personal Notes''' ===
First and foremost I believe my python skills need some revisiting as I have not touched python since my first introductory course
* For this, I will search for the best online introductory course and complete 90 minutes of review work per week
* As I am already somewhat acquainted with python 90 minutes of personal work should translate to approximately 120-150 minutes of recommended coursework time
* This week I spent most of those 90 minutes searching for the course that I think will best suit my needs
* I have decided that I will use Kaggle Learn's Introductory course to Python
* The course is 7 lessons long and is estimated to take 7 hours long 
* By my approximations for my own pace, I am planning on completing this course in about 4.5 hours or 270 minutes, which will take me exactly three weeks
