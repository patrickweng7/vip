== Week 1 - 2==
I was waiting for the conflict meeting time to be arranged.

== Week 3: September 6, 2019 - September 13, 2019 ==
'''Conflict Meeting Notes:'''
* Had the first conflict meeting
* Joined the research fundamentals subteam. 
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Read the neat-gp paper.
* Looking at how to reduce bloat in Emade.
* The objective is to learn how bloat works in evolutionary trees and go about removing it. Learn how bloat is formed.
* Worked on code outside of Emade and implement later.
* Other team members will work on hashing trees to find if redundant trees or constants in each nodes or on quantifying the bloat problem through the creation of a metric.
'''Goals:'''
* Read the neat-gp paper.

''' February 14 Team Meeting'''
* My experiment for modified neat-gp fitness sharing based on speciation is still running on generation 35.
* Planning to finish up changes and the separate runs of neat-gp and modified fitness sharing in EMADE by Friday the 21st.
* Still waiting for confirmation that speciation works perfectly. Even if speciation doesn't perfectly assign species, the two runs are worthwhile since, in the worst case, random assignment of species would still produce different results in the neat-gp and modified fitness sharing runs.
* Plan to start GCP experiments around Friday the 21st.
* We discussed removing Num Elements as an objective since that could be causing bloat as well as experimenting with different thresholds for the neat-gp processes.
* (Unmodified) neat-gp fitness sharing below on Titanic with an AUC of 5987.36 after 42 generations

'''Individual Work'''
* Vanilla EMADE (thought it was modified neat-gp fitness sharing) below on Titanic with an AUC of 5947.71 after 39 generations
* Print statements to generate the weights for selection werenâ€™t included in the output file. I found that I didnâ€™t use the updated selNSGA2 where it was needed. This means I ran vanilla EMADE which we were going to do anyways so I need to rerun EMADE with the correct updated selNSGA2

* Speciation is done but we have some issues with crossover that need to be fixed
* Fitness sharing integration is almost done. I need to do some more testing.
* Bloat (from last semester) wasn't being logged properly so I did a quick fix that I need to test.
* Now that we're modifying and placing a higher emphasis on selection, I'm going to create a metric to quantify how close individuals are on the pareto front.

'''Individual Work - Bloat'''
* Bloat isn't being logged in mysql correctly. In the database, it gets logged as -1 or -0 across all the generations and in the logs it's -2.2250738585072014e-308 across all 29 generations which doesn't seem right.
* It seems like some of the hyper volume code got edited during the neat-gp integration which affected the bloat calculations and has been fixed. The screenshots below are from the same run and have the same tree_size values but bloat is wrong and hyper volume isn't really being recorded. The left screenshot is from the database and the right screenshot is from the master output logs.
[[files/Bloat logging issues.png|400px]] [[files/Bloat logging issues 1.png|480px]]

'''Individual Work - Speciation-based Selection'''
* I'm also noticing that all the values in the fitness sharing weights for selection are pretty similar. In the following screenshot, we have 745 individuals in generation 29. 1/745 is approximately 0.00134 so if every individual was part of a different species, every individual would have around 0.00134 in its weight vector. All the values in the weights are between 0.00113 and 0.00143 but the distribution of weights definitely has noticeable trends that are affected by speciation. It would be interesting to run some trials to see how the threshold for speciation affects the distribution of weights for the species or to modify the selection weights to more drastically favor population-of-one species. 
* Since I'm no longer directly modifying the fitness values as in neat-gp, I'm going to start referring to fitness sharing as speciation-based selection.
* The most updated version of speciation has been successfully integrated into speciation-based selection with NumElements removed as an objective and I'm now running EMADE to compare against the prior run with out-of-date speciation.
[[files/Fitness sharing weights.png|400px]] [[files/Weights histogram.png|800px]]

* After 26 generations, the selection with updated speciation has an AUC of 3163.32, which is 64% lower at generation 26 and 17% lower than generation 44 for the original speciation.

'''Individual Work: Runs 1 - 5'''
* I changed the way selection works to restrict mating by speciation like neat-gp does. This should act as asexual reproduction or cloning if the population of a species is 1.

'''Run 1 - Mating restricted by speciation (speciation = 0.15)'''
* AUC for generation 35: 5950.88
[[files/Experiment1 restricted by speciation pareto front gen 35.png|500px]] [[files/Experiment1 individuals.png|700px]]
[[files/Experiment1 num individuals vs species.png|500px]]

'''Run 2 - Mating restricted by speciation (speciation = 0.15)'''
* AUC for generation 50: 4614.08
* Restricting mating by speciation appears to have had a negative impact on selection. As shown in the image below (Number of Species vs Individuals per Generation), the number of species is almost equal to the number of individuals across generations. This would nullify the impact of speciation on selection since each species would have a nearly equal probability of surviving. Across all generations, the average difference between the number of individuals and species is 6.51, meaning there are at most nearly 7 individuals in a species at any given generation.
[[files/Experiment2 restricted by speciation pareto front gen 50.png|500px]] [[files/Experiment2 individuals.png|650px]]
[[files/Experiment2 number of species vs individuals.png|500px]]

'''Run 3 - Mating unrestricted (speciation = 0.15)'''
* AUC for generation 20: 5833.04
* For some reason, my computer was stuck at generation 20 and wouldn't process any more individuals.
* I removed the previous restrictions on mating and there was a much bigger difference between the number of individuals and species per generation (average of 51.54 more individuals). Interestingly, the AUC at generation 20 was significantly lower than the AUC for generation 20 in Run 1 and Run 2, where mating was restricted by speciation. It appears that restricting mating by speciation makes speciation and fitness sharing trivial. However, we should retest this when we experiment with changing the 0.15 threshold for speciation. The threshold might just be too low.
[[files/Pareto front gen 20 experiment3.png|550px]] [[files/Experiment3 individuals.png|650px]]
[[files/Experiment3 num individuals vs species 1.png|500px]]

''' Run 4 - Mating unrestricted (speciation = 0.15)'''
* AUC for generation 20: 2087.36
* I noticed that for all four runs so far there has been a drop of about 1/3 in the number of individuals over four generations in each run. For runs 1, 3, and 4, this drop coincides with a 26%, 20%, and 62% reduction in AUC respectively although for run 2, this drop coincides with only a 1% drop in AUC. It's also interesting that the drop occurs earlier (generations 15 and 20 for runs 3 and 4) in the runs with unrestricted mating than in the runs with restricted mating (generations 29 and 37 for runs 1 and 2). Changing the rate of mating and mutation could affect this and this is something we should look into.

[[files/Run4 num individuals.png|500px]]

''' Run 5 - Mating restricted by speciation (speciation = 0.15)'''
* AUC for generation 46: 3491
* Interestingly, this is the only run where there was no major drop in the number of individuals and, out of the three runs with mating restricted, it performed the best.

== Week 10: March 9, 2020 - March 15, 2020 ==
''' Presentation Summary'''
* Based on the 5 runs I did and the 3 baseline runs Eric did, restricted mating does worse than baseline while unrestricted mating does better than both. However, our results were not statistically significant, especially given the small number of runs.
* The bloat metric from last semester shows restricted mating has bloat values consistently decreasing over time.
[[files/Titanic 5 run AUC results with averages.png|550px]] [[files/Titanic bloat 5runs.png|550px]]

''' March 9 Presentation/Next Steps'''
* We will look into:
** Look into how altering speciation distance threshold affects fitness sharing and bloat
** Evaluate restricted vs unrestricted mating
** Investigate the drop in the number of individuals by changing the rate of crossover and mutation
** Integrate fitness sharing and crossover changes 
* Based on the comments, we should look into:
** Only assigning individuals to species if the fitness is valid
** Look at difference measures for dissimilarity
* Note: For restricted mating, an individual in a species of population 1 mates with itself (cloning).

''' Individual Work: Run 7 - Mating restricted (speciation = 0.30)'''
* AUC for generation 50: 8758.16
* Average difference between the number of individuals and species was 15. Interestingly, raising the speciation threshold didn't seem to push individuals into bigger species. Almost all individuals are still their own species. This seems to be an issue with restricted mating.

''' Final Presentation Data'''
* The data analysis below is my individual work but the runs are compiled from the whole sub team. I mainly looked at the "mysterious drop" in the number of new individuals and species. These are the runs we did for the final presentation:
{| class="wikitable"
!Run
!% Drop
!# Runs
|-
|Baseline (CV = 0.9, MUT = 0.01)
|30.9%
|10
|- 
| Speciation = 0.15 (CV = 0.9, MUT = 0.01)
|28.7%
|12
|- 
| Speciation = 0.3 (CV = 0.9, MUT = 0.01)
|11.2%
|12
|- 
| Speciation = 0.6 (CV = 0.9, MUT = 0.01)
|18.2%
|13
|- 
| Speciation = 0.15 (CV = 0.9, MUT = 0.05)
|11.4%
|5
|- 
| Speciation = 0.15 (CV = 0.95, MUT = 0.05)
|26.0%
|5
|- 
|}

* The drop seems to occur mainly in Baseline EMADE and when speciation is 0.15. Interestingly, when speciation is 0.3 or 0.6, the % drop is lower by a factor of nearly 2. However, the drop still occurs and the graphs below demonstrate that the magnitude of the drop may not change significantly but the frequency among all runs might. The drops in baseline and 0.15 are also a factor of 1/2 while the drops in 0.3 and 0.6 are approximately 1/3. The drops also occur in the majority of baseline and 0.15 runs while occurring more rarely among the 0.3 and 0.6 runs. In the 0.6 runs, there was even a significant uptick in the number of new individuals by a factor of 1/2, always followed by a drop.

* The drop in the number of individuals occurred in all 10 baseline runs, 7/12 0.15 runs, 3/12 0.3 runs, and 6/12 0.6 runs. 

[[files/Average.png|550px]] 

* In the graph above, 0.3 and 0.6 runs of EMADE had the most stable average number of new individuals across all six categories.

|1.37
|- 
| Speciation = 0.3
|1.25
|- 
| Speciation = 0.6
|8.31
|- 
|}

* In comparing the number of new individuals and species, we see the greatest difference in the 0.6 threshold. This demonstrates speciation working well with an individual-species quotient of 8.31, comparing to nearly 1 for 0.15 and 0.3. 

* The graph below represents the quotient for the number of individuals over the number of species. A quotient of 1 would represent every individual as its own species. This would make fitness sharing and speciation trivial since fitness sharing uses speciation to generate a probability vector to select individuals for tournament selection and every item in this vector would be identical. The quotients for 0.15 and 0.3 were very close to 1. For these two settings, the number of individuals and species were nearly equal. It's notable that the quotient for 0.3 was lower than the quotient for 0.15 but this may have been random. It is also notable that the quotient for those two settings were nearly equal to 1. This may have occurred because most individuals may have required speciation threshold greater than 0.3. When the threshold was set to 0.6, the quotient increased by a factor of 6. This setting is much less trivial as the average species has 8.31 individuals, not nearly 1.

''' Future Work'''
* Since I'm graduating, I'll leave some ideas for looking into the mysterious drop. I think the group should consider running some runs of EMADE with speciation values between 0.3 and 0.6 or between 0.15 and 0.3. It's also notable that this drop occurred in baseline EMADE when no fitness sharing occurred at all. With PACE set up, this should be much easier and quicker. 0.6 had several increases in the number of individuals so that could be another interesting phenomenon to look into. I think the group should also consider looking at the correlation between AUC and the number of individuals. There probably won't be a significant correlation since the average number of individuals remains around 300 through most of the run but the AUC drops nonetheless. But the group could look at the AUC just during the drop to see if theres any phenomena there. I think the group should also consider altering the mutation and crossover rate, both in combination with speciation values, and in baseline EMADE alone. I did some modest changes to mutation (0.01 vs 0.05) and crossover (0.9 vs 0.95). I think the group Run EMADE with much bigger changes. Ultimately, this drop in the number of new individuals may not be traceable to any specific value nor indicative of performance. The group should also consider testing restricted mating. All of our most recent runs had unrestricted mating.
* I think the team could also look at the way the weights for selection change over time. With a large enough population, the weight values are also very small and similar. 
* Also, if there are 100 species and each species has 10 individuals, then every individual would have an identical weight. This would essentially make speciation and fitness sharing pointless, with the exception of mating restrictions. I think the team should look into altering that probability vector thats generated in fitness_sharing.py to include additional variables like fitness or pareto-optimality.
* I also [https://github.gatech.edu/efrankel6/emade/commit/d025a017b9a6dc18de9384b9f630d02acbbb37c1| modified the EMADE file to allow turning off fitness sharing] and reverting to the previous code for NSGA2 tournament selection. The code below allows anyone to change the speciation threshold, restrict mating, and turn off fitness sharing for experiments. I also added print statements to the code so the master output file will immediately give the information about fitness sharing, mating, and thresholds before it actually begins the evolutionary process.
[[files/Screen Shot 2020-04-24 at 5.07.35 PM.png|300px]]
* I also discussed creating a metric to evaluate crowding distance on the pareto front with Dr. Zutty since fitness sharing alters the NSGA-2 selection process in a way that might be interesting to study.
