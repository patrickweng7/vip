Catching up on last week's work

Worked on the one max problem with a genetic algorithm approach

Learned how to use creator and toolbox for initialization in deap

Initial population of 300 was used and ran 40 generations to complete the jupyter notebook's first problem

Experimented with two-point cross over

*GP: Genetic Programming
**GA
***Evaluation
***Fitness computation
***Selection
***Mating
***Mutation	
***Individual – used lists
		
*Genome to evaluation function then objective scores

*Genome for GP is a tree
**Output of the tree is the root of the tree
***Made of nodes and leaves
***Nodes – primitives
***Functions +, - …
***Leaves – terminal
****Inputs, constants, things that functions are consuming

*Crossover
**Swap any random points of trees (random point – tree)
**Because GP data type is restricted, mating is restricted to single-point crossover
*Mutation
**Basic operator – single point replacement
**Change one primitive to another (multiplication to division)
**Insertion mutation
**Shrink mutation – delete a node and move up the tree
	
*Symbolic Regression
**Y = sin(x)
**Primitive set : +, -, *, /
**Terminals : x, constants
**Taylor expansion
**X  - x^3/3! …
***Add more primitives to make the graph simpler

Worked on the second half of lab 2

Ran into a problem of not being able to run deap on home computer, so reinstalled deap using anaconda's command (conda install -c conda-forge deap)
*Multi-Objective Genetic Programming
**created new fitness and individual classes for the multiobjective problem
**three new primitives were added
**pareto dominance function was defined to visualize the objective space
***pareto dominance function returns true if the first individual dominates the second individual
**Result
***Best individual is: negative(cos(multiply(add(cos(sin(cos(multiply(add(cos(cos(x)), cos(add(multiply(x, x), sin(x)))), tan(x))))), cos(x)), tan(x)))) with fitness: (0.27530582924947056, 25.0)

Going over the next assignment

learned how to set up python environment

Kaggle kernels and jupyter notebook for ML on titanic

Went through sample data and took out nan values for cleaner data input

The ML model ranked in pretty low with .77 accuracy on Kaggle
*Result
**True Positive (TP): 488	
**False Negative (FN): 98
**False Positive (FP): 61	
**True Negative (TN): 244
***Methods took to obtain the above result:
****For the missing data parameters:
*****Searched for NaN values and instead of deleting the entire line, took the average of the column and replaced NaN with average for better generalization
****Performed random forest for the predictions
*Created Pareto Front graph for the group which was posted on the VIP subgroup page (group 4)
*Below is the confusion matrix of the above model

Emade Install Day

To install Emade, directions on the emade github was followed : https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade

The installation process went smoothly and when the emade command was ran, the following output was obtained.

For Next Week:
* Make sure you have at least one entry per week

* Every entry needs a to-do list
* Link everything
* Usability: Can a future (or current student) reproduce results or learn from your entry?
* Presentations:
** Class will be long
** Everyone is expected to present
** Plan on 10 minutes for the presentation
** Bootcamp emphasis on comparing results between EMADE / GP / Handcoding
Our group decided to meet on March 6, at 3:30 pm to work on the presentation

Asked Jason's help for the SCOOP error I was having previously and the solution was very simple.

All that was needed to be done  was adding the computer name as the localhost in /etc/hosts file on my computer

Now Emade runs with no problem on local host

Our group (group 4) decided to used Gabriel's computer as Master since he had been running his emade process much earlier than the rest of us

With his ip, database name, and password, I tried running the emade command with "-w" just to run as worker, but so far I was not successful in connecting to his database

The worker.err file keeps throwing: (2006, “Can’t connect to MySQL server on ‘128.61.52.73’ (60)“) (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/e3q8)

Decided to meet tomorrow and work on the problem

Continued working on getting other member's computer to connect to our master server

Problem still not resolved, same error as previous journal entry appears

Decided to go to the help desk tomorrow

Planned for our group project

Decided to create a shared google drive to collect all the data results in one place for easy ppt creation

Prepare presentation materials for next meeting on Friday

Met with the group to prepare for Monday's presentation.

Worked on the intro slides of the presentation.

The four of us (new to the group) decided to present the introduction part of Monday's presentation.

== April 22, 2019 ==
Presentation day.

Worked on slides 5, 6, and 7 (Background of our overall process)

As for the grade I deserve, I would love to say I deserve an A, but as a first-semester student, a month with the team felt like a very short time to really contribute. Honestly, I played catch-up and spent most of the time trying to understand the team's problem and their problem-solving process. During the last two weeks, I have been placed to a subteam of researching papers for materials that may be implemented to our project in the future. Really looking forward to next semester!

Also, for addressing feedbacks, I tried to specify more for the contents in the to-do lists.

== Documents Being Read ==
'''Seizure prediction by non‐linear time series analysis of brain electrical activity'''

Christian E. Elger Klaus Lehnertz https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1460-9568.1998.00090.x

- 16 people studied for seizure activities using ECoG and SEEG

- moving windows analysis is also used

- dimension reduction shows positive results

- overlapping of the windows

(check page 788) 

'''Regional brain activity and strenuous exercise: Predicting affective responses using EEG asymmetry'''

Eric E.Hal https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051107000518

- graded exercises on treadmill in 10a a mi interval

- focuses on alpha waves specifically 

- signals were amplified and filtered (check section 2.2)
