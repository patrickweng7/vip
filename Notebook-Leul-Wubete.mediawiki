===Lecture Notes:===
* Introduced to project requirements:  Rubric, Syllabus, JupyterLab, Python deap, 
* Shown emade's GitHub, Wiki, Personal Progress Notebooks, Python Jupyter Notebooks, Slack
* Intro to Genetic Algorithms:
    -  The evolution and DNA of the computing world.
    -  Multiple solutions to complex problems, AKA genomes, that can mutate with other solutions given evaluation/fitness.
    -  You can do mating/mutation -> next gen, we loop the process until we find the perfect specimen.
* "Individual"
    -  One candidate in the population
    -  A single organism
* "Population"
    -  Group of individuals to be experimented upon
* "Objective"
    -  Individual's performance measurement
    -  This is like a credit score
* "Fitness"
    -  How good individual is compared to others.
* "Evaluation"
    -  Takes individual and spits out objective.
* "Selection"
    -  Gives preference to better individuals to pass on their genes
    *  2 types:
        -  I. Fitness Proportionate: fitness value is the deciding factor, most fit from all moves on.
        -  II. Tournament: given group of n individuals, most fit is selected for mating. A bit more of a real life scenario.
* "Mating"/"Crossover"
    -  mating between individuals, DNA is combined from individuals.
    -  examples: single point splice, double point splice, ... represented as python list splicing and joining.
* "Mutation"
    -  Inserting change to an individual (changing a person's DNA)
    -  Why? Keep diversity as a factor.
* Algorithms
    -  Initialize population
    -  Consider population fitness (survival of fittest)
    -  Repeat and pick the chosen one:
        1. Select parents
        2. Mating actions
        3. Mutations
        4. Determine fitness
        5. (until the best individual is acceptable)

===Lab 1 walkthrough/personal progression Notes:===
* Downloaded and installed pip for Windows 10
* pip installed jupyterLab for Windows 10
* Added python to my environment variables
* I launched JupyterLab from cmd using 'jupyter-lab' command.
* downloaded DEAP Problem from the Calendar, under the week 1 Assignments column. Saved the file as .ipynb
* Imported Lab1 .ipynb into JupyterLab via the jupyterLab file explorer GUI.
* Opened a new command prompt and used 'pip install deap' to install deap

===Lab 1 Notes:===

===oneMax===
* we defined the name of the class, the inherited class, and the objectives.
    - creator.create("FitnessMax", base.Fitness, weights=(1.0,))
      weight is the objective, if we wanted multi-objective, maybe something like (1.0, -1.0)
* Deap's toolbox
    - DEAP's toolbox.register, we generate individuals with their attributes and how many attributes each individual container should have.
* evalOneMax()
    - simple algorithm to return the # of 1's in a list.
* Genetic Operations
    - Evaluate: evalOneMax()
    - Mate: a two-point crossover function (tools.cxTwoPoint)
    - Mutate: is defined as flipping a bit in our bitstring to either 1 or 0, independent probability of flipping each individual bit of 5%.
    - Select: tournament selection of 3 individuals
* Evaluating our population
    - mapped the evaluation function, then assigning fitness by zipping individuals and their fitness together:
       fitnesses = list(map(toolbox.evaluate, pop))
       for ind, fit in zip(pop, fitnesses):
           ind.fitness.values = fit 
* Evolution process
    - After the tournament selection, clone the offspring so they do not mix with the last loop.
    - next is crossover mutation, where we zip the 2 versions of the list, one being the odd skip, the other being the even skip.
    - in the chance we generate a random < 0.5, we will be mating the two and deleting their separate fitness values.
    - mutate individuals having <20% probabilities and deleted the mutated offspring's fitness values.
    - individuals with invalid fitness in offspring will have their fitness evaluated and then given fitness values, then we set the pop to offspring.
    - found max, min, avg, and standard deviation statistics for the new pop.

===N Queens===
* A conceptually simple problem, knowing that a queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, how can we stack queens on an n x n board in
* each row, so that no one queen can reach another queen?
* Make fitness and individual classes for sample 20 x 20 board. Fitness is negative weight, why? We want to minimize conflicting queen paths.
* Each individual is
