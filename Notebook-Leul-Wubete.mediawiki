===Lecture Notes:===
* Introduced to project requirements:  Rubric, Syllabus, JupyterLab, Python deap, 
* Shown emade's GitHub, Wiki, Personal Progress Notebooks, Python Jupyter Notebooks, Slack
* Intro to Genetic Algorithms:
    -  The evolution and DNA of the computing world.
    -  Multiple solutions to complex problems, AKA genomes, that can mutate with other solutions given evaluation/fitness.
    -  You can do mating/mutation -> next gen, we loop the process until we find the perfect specimen.
* "Individual"
    -  One candidate in the population
    -  A single organism
* "Population"
    -  Group of individuals to be experimented upon
* "Objective"
    -  Individual's performance measurement
    -  This is like a credit score
* "Fitness"
    -  How good individual is compared to others.
* "Evaluation"
    -  Takes individual and spits out objective.
* "Selection"
    -  Gives preference to better individuals to pass on their genes
    *  2 types:
        -  I. Fitness Proportionate: fitness value is the deciding factor, most fit from all moves on.
        -  II. Tournament: given group of n individuals, most fit is selected for mating. A bit more of a real life scenario.
* "Mating"/"Crossover"
    -  mating between individuals, DNA is combined from individuals.
    -  examples: single point splice, double point splice, ... represented as python list splicing and joining.
* "Mutation"
    -  Inserting change to an individual (changing a person's DNA)
    -  Why? Keep diversity as a factor.
* Algorithms
    -  Initialize population
    -  Consider population fitness, survival of fittest
    -  Repeat and pick the chosen one:
        1. Select parents
        2. Mating actions
        3. Mutations
        4. Determine fitness
        5. (until the best individual is acceptable)

===Lab 1 walkthrough/personal progression Notes:===
* Downloaded and installed pip for Windows 10
* pip installed jupyterLab for Windows 10
* Added python to my environment variables
* I launched JupyterLab from cmd using 'jupyterLab' command.
* downloaded DEAP Problem from the Calendar, under the week 1 Assignments column. Saved the file as .ipynb
* Imported Lab1 .ipynb into JupyterLab via the jupyterLab file explorer GUI.
* Opened a new command prompt and used 'pip install deap' to install deap
