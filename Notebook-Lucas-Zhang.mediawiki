No Meeting due to Labor Day

== Neural Architecture Search Meeting: Friday, September 10, 2021 ==

*Met with the other NAS subteam members for a little over an hour.
*We went over the brainstorming ideas, todos etc. on the  [https://trello.com/b/RbwUW89F/nas-brainstorm our Trello board]. Access may only limited to NAS subteam members. 

*Brainstorming ideas on [https://trello.com/b/RbwUW89F/nas-brainstorm Trello board]
**Speeding up EMADE
*** Goal is to generate a tokenization process which only needs to occur once. The results of this tokenization process will be made accessible by all future individuals generated rather than forcing individuals/EmadeDataPairs to undergo their own expensive tokenization process.

**Novelty detection
*** Goal is to incorporate some reward into made which encourages individuals to use components/layers which have not been used by other individuals prior. This would help diversify the number of individuals per generation allowing for the discovery of ideal individuals fast.

**Triviality
*** Goal is to set up some sort of penalization within made for individuals that simply guess the same clarifications constantly without any effective algorithmic considerations.

**Add some test scripts for debugging
*** Goal is to create a test file as a starting point for creating some test cases that quickly reproduce undesirable individuals. This test file will be created by using a simple dataset such as MNIST or CIFAR-10 and add a template file that is small enough to generate around 5 generations for a local run.

* We decided that our weekly meeting times are going to be Fridays from 2 pm to 3pm.

*Justin Hsu Hinckley joined the NAS team from the stocks team
*On 9/29/2021, I met with Cameron Bennett and Cameron Whaley to discuss setting up PACE and the task regarding "Debugging /Reproducing issue with test_swap line300 EMADE.py".

*I wasn't able to attend Cameron Bennett and Cameron Whaley's presentation, "Guide to EMADE.py" live due to a time conflict so I watched a recording of it.
Guide to EMADE.py Presentation Notes:
*Agenda
**EMADE Object
**Helper Functions
**Mating/Mutation Functions
**Master Algorithm
**Worker Algorithm
*EMADE Object
**Contains methods to feed input XML arguments into deap
**On init: creates empty toolbox
*create_representation(self, adfs=0, regression= False)
**Does a few important things: self.pset = gp.PrimitiveSetTyped('MAIN', [EmadeDataPair], EmadeDataPair)
** Functionality to create Automatically Defined Functions (ADFs) added to toolbox
*** Creates self.pset to store primitives/ADFs
****Initialized by adding MAIN primitive to self.pset
*setObjective(self, objectivesDict) and setDatasets(self, datasetDict)
**Both assign their one argument as a class attribute
**setObjectives uses objective bounds to define area for hypervolume (AUC) calculations
**setDatasets creates constructs a deap creator,Individual, adds its fitness attributes, and adds it to the toolbox
***Also registers the following to the toolbox: population (list of inds), selection algorithm, tournament algorithm, mating/mutation functions, evaluation functions, and misc function used to modify individuals.

* buildClassifier(self)
**Actually loads datasets using arguments from self.datasetDict()
**Uses different loading function based on type of data
**Loads datasets and metadata into EmadeDataPair object, which is assigned to self.datasetDict[dataset name]['dataPairArray']

**Target data for test set is assigned to self.datasetDict[dataSet name]['truthDataArray'] + "truth data" datapair attribute 
**Test set's target data is overwritten in the datapairs(s)

*Helper Functions Used in EMADE.py
** handleWorker(func, dataPair, return_dict, my_queue, ind_hash)
***Purpose: Execute evaluation method in separate process and store within return_dict
***Used By: evaluate_individual
***Nested method: sigterm_handler_sub(signal, frame)
***Terminates the evaluation process upon completion of evaluation

**setObjectives(self, objectivesDict)
***Purpose: Construct 3 tuples to define the space of our objective goals and achievability along with our weights for each
***Affects FitnessMin within toolbox
***Affected variables:
****LROI: a hypercube defining the minimum acceptable objective values
****SROI: a hypercube defining where solutions are known to be possible
***Args: objectives_dict <= defined in launchEMADE.py

* Met from 2 pm to 3:15 pm to give the sub-team updates regarding our weekly progress.
* Cameron Whaley talked about an issue that he encountered regarding the latest merge onto the nn-vip branch. We then decided to work off of Cameron Whaley's fork while the issue was being resolved. Justin resolved this issue by reverting the previous three commits and merging [https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/pull/200 a PR] onto this branch.
* Justin, Conner, and both Camerons helped Justin and I resolve errors regarding setting up Pace. We found out that one of our errors were from being on the EZCGP team in that one of our folders on pace were pointing to Rodd's account.
* We scheduled an optional work meeting on Monday for us to meet up and help each other make progress.

* '''Lecture Content'''
'''''Genetic Algorithm''''' 
*Evaluate each individual in a population of solutions. 
*If stopping criteria are not met, a new generation is created through mating/mutation and the evaluation step is performed again.
** Terms:
*** Individual: one specific candidate in the population (with properties such as DNA)
*** Population/Generation: a group of individuals whose properties will be altered to obtain a new generation
*** Objective: a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize (usually the goal is to increase objective through the evolutionary algorithm)
*** Fitness: Relative comparison to other individuals; how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to the rest of the population?
*** Evaluation: a function that computes the objective of an individual
** Selection: represents â€˜survival of the fittestâ€™; gives preference to better individuals, therefore allowing them to pass on their genes.
* Selection methods:
*** Fitness Proportionate: the greater the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected for mating
*** Tournament: several tournaments among individuals (number of individuals in each tournament is dependent on tournament size); winners are selected for mating.
** Genetic Algorithms for creating a new generation:
*** Mating/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
*** Mutation: Introduces random modification; purpose is to maintain diversity
** Genetic Algorithm Steps:
**# Random initialization of population
**# Determine fitness of population
**#Repeat...
***# select parents from population
***# perform crossover on parents creating population
***# perform mutation of population
***# determine fitness of population
***Keep going until best individual is good enough
** One Max Problem:
*** The problem begins with individuals that contain a list of 100 values that are either zero or one
*** The goal is to eventually produce an individual that contains all ones Lab 1:

== Bootcamp Meeting 2: January 27, 2021 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* '''Lecture Content'''
'''''Last Week: Genetic Algorithms''''' 
* Population based solution
* Used concepts from natural selection to evolve individuals
* Used properties of DNA to exchange and change information between individuals
* Individuals represented as list
**[Gene_0, Gene_1, Gene_2, â€¦, Gene_N-1]

'''''This Week: Genetic Programming''''' 
* Instead of taking an individual and having a function evaluator to obtain objective scoresâ€¦
** The individual is the function itself

** Terms:
* '''genetic algorithms: '''a population-based solution to optimizing properties of algorithms.
* '''genotypic diversity: '''how similar is the structure of an algorithm.
* '''phenotypic diversity: '''how similar are the fitness levels and objective scores of 2 algorithms
* '''Lisp preordered parse tree:''' Operator followed by inputs list
* '''Leaves/terminals:''' tree abstractions to represent parameters.
* '''Nodes/primitives:''' tree abstractions to represent functions
* '''Cross in GP: ''' Cross over in tree-based GP is simply exchanging subtrees

*'''Tree Representation'''
* We can represent a program as a tree structure
** Nodes are called primitives and represent functions
** Leaves are called terminals and represent parameters
*** The input can be thought of as a particular type of terminal.
*** The output is produced at the root of the tree

**'''How is the Tree Stored?'''
* The tree is converted to a lisp preordered parse tree.
**Operator followed by inputs
* The tree for f(x) = 3*4+1 can be written as: [+,*,3,4,1]
* This comes from using the root first and then expanding:
[+, input1, input2]
[+,*, input3, input4, 1]

*'''Crossover in GP'''
** Crossover in tree-based GP is simply exchanging subtrees
** Start by randomly picking a point in each tree
** These points and everything below create subtrees
** The subtrees are then exchanged to produce children

'''''Mutation in GP''''' 
Mutation can involve...
** Inserting a node or subtree
** Deleting a node or subtree
** Changing a node 

*'''''Symbolic Regression''''' 
* Using simple primitives to evolve solutions

*'''''Symbolic Regression Example: Evolve a solution to y = sin(x)''''' 
Primitives: +, *, -, /
Terminals:  integers and a variable "x"
We can use the Taylor series to form a polynomial approximation to sin(x)

*'''''Evaluating a tree''''' 
* We can feed a number of input points into the function to get outputs
** X = [0..2pi]
* Run f(X)
* We can measure error between outputs and truth (e.g. the sum square error example)

*'''''What Primitives Could Make This Evolution Easier''''' 
* Power(0)
* Factorial()
* Sin()
* Cos()
* Tan()

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* '''Lecture Content'''
'''''Multiple Objectives- The MO in MOGA and MOGP''''' 
* Genetic Programming Life Cycle: New Gene Pool â†’ Evaluation â†’ Genes w/ scores â†’ Fitness Computation â†’ Genes w/ fitness â†’ Selection â†’ Parental Genes â†’ Mating â†’ Child Genes â†’ Mutation â†’ New Gene Pool
 
* '''New Gene Pool'''
* Gene pool is the set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation
** Genome
*** Genotypic description of an individuals
*** DNA
*** GA = set of values
*** GP tree structure, string
** Search Space
*** Set of all possible genome
*** For Automated Algorithm Design
**** Set of all possible algorithms
*** How big is the search space?
*** Why is this important for algorithm design

* '''Objective Space'''
* The Evaluation of a Genome associates a genome/individual (set of parameters for GA or string for GP) with a set of scores 
* What are these scores
** True Positive - TP
*** How often are we identifying the desired object
** False Positive - FP
*** How often are we identifying something else as the desired object
** More? - On board, next page
* Objectives
** Set of measurements each genome (or individual) is scored against
** Phenotype
* Objective Space - Set of objectives
* Evaluation - Maps an genome/Individual
** From a location in search space
*** Genotypic description
** To a location in objective space
*** Phenotype description

* '''Terms'''
True Positive (TP): an outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class.
True Negative (TN): an outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class.
False Positive (FP): an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class.
False Negative (FN): an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class.

* '''Stats Measures'''
** True Positive Rate (TPR): TP/P = TP/(TP+FN)
** True Negative Rate (TNR): TN/N = TN/(FP+TN)
** False Negative Rate (FNR): FN/P = FN/(TP+FN) = 1 - TPR
**False Positive Rate (FPR): FP/N = FP/(FP+TN) = 1 - TNR
**Positive Predictive Value (PPV): TP/(TP+FP)
**False Discovery Rate (FDR): FP/(TP+FP) = 1 - PPV
**Negative Predictive Value (NPV): TN/(TN+FN)
**Accuracy (ACC): (TP+TN)/(P+N) = (TP+TN)/(TP+FN+FP+TN)

* '''Objective Space'''
* Each individual is evaluated using objective functions
** Mean squared error
** Cost
** Complexity
** True positive rate
** False positive rate
** Etcâ€¦
* Objective scores give each individual a point in objective space
* This may be referred to as the phenotype of the individual

* '''Pareto Optimality'''
* An individual is Pareto optimal if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives
* The set of all Pareto individuals is known as the Pareto frontier
* These individuals represent unique contributions
* We want to drive selection by favoring Pareto individuals
** But maintain diversity by giving all individuals some probability of mating

* '''Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II'''
* Population is separated into nondomination ranks
* Individuals are selected using a binary tournament
* Lower Pareto ranks beat higher Pareto raks
* Ties on the same front are broken by crowing distances
** Summation of normalized Euclidian distances to all points within the front
** Higher crowding distance wins

* '''Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)'''
* Each individual is given a strength S
** S is how many others in the population it dominates
* Each individual receives a rank R
** R is the sum of Sâ€™s of the individuals that dominate it
** Pareto individuals are nondominated and receive an R of 0
* A distance to the Kth nearest neighbor (Ïƒ^k) is calculated and a fitness of R + 1/((Ïƒ^k)+ 2) is obtained

'''ezCGP Meeting: Thursday 4/8/2021:'''
* In the mating group we read a research paper together: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77553-1_13 
**The paper was a comparative study of crossover in CGP
**In the paper, the experiment involved selecting parent genomes for the next generation by using 2 separate tournaments. This makes it so that the sample individual can be picked multiple times.

'''Research paper notes:'''
 - CGP is often used with mutation as the sole operator.
 - This paper is on a comparative study of previously proposed crossover techniques for CGP.
 - The results of the experiment shows that it is possible for a crossover operator to outperform the standard (1 + lambda) strategy on a limited number of tasks.
 - A universal operator in CGP still remains open to find

'''ezCGP Meeting: Thursday 4/22/2021 Notes:'''
*We began working on final presentation slides.
*The team made a slide that outlined our presentation. It showed the order of topics that we were going to present in and who was presenting each topic.
'''Personal Work'''
*I met with Monil and Rodd to talk through our tasks and I was able to complete some to-dos on the parameter search problem file.
*The 2 main tasks that we were given for parameter search:
** 1.  Create a new output file structure that would save the generations in an a way that is organized, so that each different combination of population size and genome size are saved in a separate directory.
** 2.  implementing a way to get the best fitness values of each combination and outputting the best parameter combination according to the fitness values.

*Jason checked the progress of each team
*The final presentation is on April 30th at 6pm


'''ezCGP Meeting: Thursday 4/29/2021'''
* Everyone on the ezCGP team did a final review of the presentation slides that we all made to make sure that everything needed is included and that our information is accurate.
* Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eMU46VktpHKwrQK5wQQ_oSM8ZK6Zzxky1rn5YFm27iw/edit?usp=sharing

'''Personal Work'''
'''I did the slide on the meta-parameter search'''
*[[files/MetaparamSlide.JPG]]
*'''My script for the presentation:'''
Lucas -  Meta-evolution can be very expensive in terms of the computational effort required to find an optimal parameter setting. Since the GP benchmark problems can be very noisy in terms of finding the ideal solution, the evolution of the evolved individual is repeated multiple times, with the fitness defined as the mean result. So what Meta-Parameter Search, is about, is it is implementing a new way to run ezCGP so that we can easily run different iterations of the same problems while making small edits before each run. For the first round of meta-evolution, all problems use the same setting. During the second round , the granularity and range were modified to better fit each individual problem. Since, the (1+lambda) scheme doesnt use tournament selection nor elitism, the 2 parameters have been ignored during its meta-evolution. Because the computational effort that is required to perform a parameter sweep grows exponentially with the number of parameters, only the two most important parameters, mutation rate and population size, were included in the sweep. Elitism rate: The ideal elitism rate was similar across all problems and types of crossover. The ideal elitism rate was similar across all problems and types of crossover. The ideal genotype length was highly variable and largely depended on the problem, rather than the type of crossover used. For the sweep, the genotype length was set up individually for each problem.





'''AAD Main Meeting: Friday 4/30/2021 Notes:'''
Each team is giving their final presentation today.

'''Stocks:'''
*Had 2 notable individuals. Used monte carlo simulations. They calculated profits on stock with random buy and sell trades and found the mean and standard deviation of profits to create a gaussian.
*Showed visualize of individuals compared to randomness.
* Did a buy/hold comparison
**Compare profit to a buy hold strategy.
* Buy/sell lag
**Calculate distance of buy/sell decision to extrema
** Compute the average lag
**Benefits
***Minimal impact from overall stock pattern
***Provides a price independent measurement
**Downfalls:
Primitives Analysis
* Determine which TI's and which ML learners have the best performance
** Used 1917 valid individuals as the sample space
Issues and Future Work
*Compare levels of generalization of optimal models
*Statistical analysis of seeding/types of sees on AUC
*Creating bounded objective functions
*Applying Fundamental analysis in addition to Technical Analysis
* Effectiveness of EMADE on hourly/intraday

Becoming more research heavy:
*VIP is supposed to function as a research group
*Demonstrate something new, something new to the world and contribute that.
*A certain amount of control and experimentation is needed
*Jason wants us to become a little more rigorous with our research.


'''NLP'''
*NNLearner Refresher

*LayerListL Refresher
**LayerList - Python list of layer primitives
*Last Semester Woes
**Had trivial solutions
**Dealt with difficult datasets
*Semester Goals
*First Half
**Choose a simpler dataset
**Streamline how we run EMADE
*Second Half:
**Run EMADE, examine the shortcomings of our implementations of NAS
**Look for improvements in increasing order
*Using PACE-ICE
**At start of semester, no one could reliably run our branch of EMADE
*Problems we solved
**PACE-specific
***Didn't have an up-to-date conda environment but now they have a working .yml file in repo
***They had a ton of MySQL errors
***They added support for multiple worker nodes

*Showed MySQL issues and solutions
*Pretrained Embedding Layers
**Word embedding-vector representation of words learned by a predefined vocabulary 
**Embedding Layer - neural network layer that takes in word embedding
***Input_dim: size of vocabulary
*Documentation and Resources
**Primitives Documentation
***Ported Notion documents to wiki that details 
*New DataSet

**Amazon Product Review Dataset
***Binary Classification

*Promising Non-trivial Solutions

*Configurations for FPR/FNR Run
**Accuracy Score 
*Run with Pareto Optimal Individuals
*Run 1 Pareto Front
*Run 2 Pareto Optimal Individuals
*Run 2 - Pareto Front
*Run 2 - Individual
*See how much EMADE improves over seeds?

'''Modularity'''
* Exploring ways to abstract parts of individuals
* This allows for us to create "building blocks" that can help with the genetic process
* EMADE already uses machine learning models as a form of abstraction
**Primitives can be models instead of simple operations found in GP
*Current implementation is based on Adaptive Representation through Learning (ARLS)
*ARL Complexity Summary
** Edited multiple other methods to deal with the increased depth of ARLs
**These methods contract places where arl subtrees are found in the population into just the single arl primitive node creat the lambda function that composes the arl node, pass data into made
**Originally, these methods passed in the children directly, but now these methods search for the arl subtree because of the arbitrary depth they could be.
*Future Work
**New Models
***Deep Ensembles with a diversity term
***A CNN architecture with decaying learning rate
**Selection Method
**Selection Method
***Modifying the evolutionary selection method to help encourage the spread of ARLs throughout the population and complexity.
**New Dataset Training
***Look at other datasets to expand ARL training to see which ARLs stored in the database are the most used and why.
***Practice on more image datasets and multi-class classification datasets.
**Diversity measure
***Create some quantifiable way to measure diversity, generalizable for EMADE. Made use a diversity measure as a heuristic when finding ARLs.
**ARL Database Storage
***IMprove the way ARLs are stored in the database to keep any information from being lost
**EMADE Integration
***Integrate ARLs with EMADE's original architecture and other modularity techniques
**More Runs
