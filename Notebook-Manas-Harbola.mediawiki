===Lab 2: Symbolic Regression (Part 2)===

===Action Items===

== Week 2: September 1st ==

=== Class Summary===

* Intro/Overview of Genetic Programming
* Representing programs as Tree Structures
* Crossover/Mutation in Genetic Programming
* Symbolic Regression

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* Conducted brief review of last week's lecture on Genetic Algorithms
* Genetic Algorithms are a population-based solution, using concepts such as natural selection and properties of DNA to exchange/modify information between individuals
* '''Genetic Algorithms''' have an evaluator function to obtain objective scores on individuals, whereas in '''Genetic Programming''', the individuals are the function themselves.

* A way to represent program structure in Genetic Programming is to use a '''Tree Representation'''.
** '''Nodes''' are called '''primitives''' represent functions
** '''Leaves''' are called '''terminals''' and represent parameters
*** Input can be thought as a particular type of terminal
*** Output is produced at root of tree

* Trees are stored by converting them to a '''lisp preordered parse tree'''.
** Operators are followed by inputs
** For example, the tree for '''f(x) = 3*4+1''' can be written as '''[+,*,3,4,1,]'''
** Parse tree of '''f(x) = 2-(0+1)''' is '''[-,2,+,0,1]'''

* Crossovers in GP are handled by simply exchanging subtrees
** Start by randomly picking a point in each tree
** These points and everything below create subtrees
** Subtrees are exchanged to produce children

* Mutations in GP can involve:
** Inserting a node or subtree
** Deleting a node or subtree
** Changing a node

* Symbolic Regression
** Using simple primitives, we can use GP to evolve a solution to '''y=sin(x)'''
** Primitives include: '''+, *, -, /'''
** Terminals include integers and variable input '''X'''
** Calculus uses Taylor Series to approach this problem

* Evaluating a Tree
** Feed inputs into function to get outputs
** Run '''f(x)''' to get result
** Measure error between output of '''f(x)''' and expected output - for instance, we can use sum square error for the y=sin(x) situation

* Primitives that could make evolution easier:
** Power(), Factorial(), Sin(), Cos(), Tan()
** '''Main Idea behind EMADE'''

===Lab 2: Symbolic Regression (Part 1)===
In this lab, I ran the evolutionary algorithm several times to observe the improves in best fit individuals. Here are the following results

'''First try, no modifications:'''
*Best individual was add(add(multiply(x, add(x, subtract(x, x))), multiply(x, multiply(add(x, multiply(x, x)), x))), x), (1.0195405384704813e-16,)

'''Second try, add primitives:'''
*Added primitives were ''np.square'' and ''np.absolute''
*Best individual was add(add(multiply(absolute(absolute(absolute(add(multiply(square(x), x), square(x))))), x), square(absolute(x))), x), (8.620776339403237e-17,)

'''Third try, add mutations, no primitives:'''
*Added mutation was ''mutShrink''
*Best individual is add(x, multiply(x, add(multiply(x, x), add(multiply(multiply(x, x), x), x)))), (1.1608501979530989e-16,)

'''Fourth try, added primitives and mutation:'''
*Best individual is Best individual is add(add(multiply(add(x, multiply(x, x)), x), multiply(x, multiply(multiply(x, x), x))), x), (9.846703645016068e-17,)

== Week 1: August 25th ==

=== Class Summary ===

* Intro to Automated Algorithm Design, Wiki, Syllabus, Notebooks
* Introductory lecture to Genetic Algorithms
* One Max Problem discussion

=== Team Meeting Notes ===

* Genetic Algorithms
** With '''genetic algorithms''', each new generation is created through '''mating/mutation''' of '''individuals''' in the previous population  
** Fitness evaluation is done through the Fitness Proportionate (randomization) or Tournament
** Fitness evaluation occurs before mating/mutation
** Goal is to produce individual best fit for selected task after several generations

* Important Keywords
** '''Individual:''' One specific candidate in the population (with properties such as DNA). The individual is usually intended as a solution to a problem
** '''Population:''' Group of individuals/solutions whose properties will be altered
** '''Objective:''' Value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize (usually the goal is to increase objective through the evolutionary algorithm)
** '''Fitness:''' Relative comparison to other individuals of the population; how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to rest of population?
** '''Evaluation:''' Function that computes the objective of an individual
** '''Selection:''' Represents â€˜survival of the fittest'; gives preference to better individuals, therefore allowing them to pass on their genes
*** '''Fitness Proportionate:''' Higher the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected for mating.
*** '''Tournament:''' Several tournament style (number of individuals in each tournament is dependent on tournament size); Winners are selected for mating
** '''Mate/Crossover:''' Represents mating between individuals.
** '''Mutate:''' Introduce random modification; purpose is to maintain diversity

===Lab 1: Genetic Algorithms with DEAP===

'''One Max problem:''' Simple genetic algorithm problem with the objective of finding a bit string containing all 1s with a set length. The following steps were followed for this lab:
* Import base, creator, tools from DEAP module and python random module
* Define fitness objective and individual classes using DEAP's creator
* Define individuals in population as booleans represented as 1s and 0s
* Define evaluation function for fitness objective as sum of all 1s in bit string
* For 40 generations, select the offspring for next generation, perform tournament selection, mate, and mutate
* '''Observations:''' Maximum fitness score was almost always achieved after 40 generations, although it wasn't guaranteed. However, the maximum fitness score by the 40th generation was always between 97.0-100.0.

'''N Queens Problem:''' Objective is to determine a configuration of n queens on a nxn chessboard such that no queen can be taken by another. For this version, each queen is assigned to one column and only one queen can be on each line. The following steps were followed for this lab:
* Import necessary DEAP modules
* Define fitness and individual classes as well as fitness objective and evaluation function
* Fitness objective is to minimize the number of conflicts between two queens on nxn chessboard
* Individual is defined as a list of n numbers denoting the column location of n queens in nxn chessboard
* Evaluation function returns number of conflicts between queens along diagonal of chessboard
* Define partially matched crossover function and mutate function to shuffle indices
* Run main evolutionary loop for 100 generations
* Algorithm doesn't consistently achieve minimum of 0.0 but gets consistently close to it
