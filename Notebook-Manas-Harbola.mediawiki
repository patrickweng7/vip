'''Class Summary:'''

* Intro to Automated Algorithm Design, Wiki, Syllabus, Notebooks
* Introductory lecture to Genetic Algorithms
* One Max Problem discussion

'''Team/Lecture Notes:'''

* <u> Genetic Algorithms </u>
** With '''genetic algorithms''', each new generation is created through '''mating/mutation''' of '''individuals''' in the previous population  
** Fitness evaluation is done through the Fitness Proportionate (randomization) or Tournament
** Fitness evaluation occurs before mating/mutation
** Goal is to produce individual best fit for selected task after several generations

* <u>Important Keywords</u>
** Individual: One specific candidate in the population (with properties such as DNA). The individual is usually intended as a solution to a problem
** Population: Group of individuals/solutions whose properties will be altered
** Objective: Value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize (usually the goal is to increase objective through the evolutionary algorithm)
** Fitness: Relative comparison to other individuals of the population; how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to rest of population?
** Evaluation: Function that computes the objective of an individual
** Selection: Represents â€˜survival of the fittest'; gives preference to better individuals, therefore allowing them to pass on their genes
*** Fitness Proportionate: Higher the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected for mating.
*** Tournament: Several tournament style (number of individuals in each tournament is dependent on tournament size); Winners are selected for mating
** Mate/Crossover: Represents mating between individuals.
** Mutate: Introduce random modification; purpose is to maintain diversity
