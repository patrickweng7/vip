=== Meeting Notes ===

==== Automated Algorithms Overview ====
* In ML, algorithm solutions often stop when they are "good enough"
* In an automated approach, we can have a computer learn how to design the algorithms like a researcher
* Based on evolutionary principles
* VIP is more like a research group and less like a traditional class
* Grade is 1/3 documentation (notebook), 1/3 contributions, 1/3 peer review

==== Genetic Algorithms ====
* One of the most basic evolutionary algorithms
* Each generation is created through mating/ mutation of individuals in population
* Goal is to produce an individual whose fitness is better than everyone else's
* Basically a search through possible parameters 
* Process
** Initialize Population
*** Individuals treated as DNA
*** Initialize random candidates
** Evaluation
*** Score each individual
*** Called fitness
** Selection
*** Select a population of parents based on fitness
*** Fitness Proportionate
**** Greater the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected
*** Tournament
**** Randomly select a number of individuals (tournament size) and pick most fit
** Crossover
*** Parents exchange information to create children
** Mutation
*** Randomly change elements in individual DNA

==== Set Up ====
* Need to install Jupyter
* First install anaconda
* Once installed, navigate to directory and run "jupyter notebook"
** This brings up a web browser
* Lab can be found in emade/notebooks lab 1 with DEAP
** Open Raw in github
** Save as .ipynb
** Run jupyter notebook
* Walk through is more detailed then lab
