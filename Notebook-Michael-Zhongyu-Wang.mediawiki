== April 17, 2019 ==
* No updates (busy with some other class projects and final preparations)

== Final Comments ==
* I think that I deserve a B given that there were a couple of weeks where I got busy and couldn't commit that much time to the project. There were definitely people in the team that have worked harder than me.
* I am finishing my commitment to the VIP, but I am also graduating, so I will not be able to TA.
