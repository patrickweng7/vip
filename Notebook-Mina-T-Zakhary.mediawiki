== March 3, 2021 ==
* Missed the meeting due to sickness/watched the recording.
* My group presented our GP/ML presentation.
* Went over how to run/use EMADE.
** Input files.

'''Lecture Notes:'''
* Team Presentations:
** Our Presentation, Group 4, was delayed to next session due to lack of time.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* We began with a quick template for GP algorithms from the previous labs.
* Primitives used:
** Add, Subtract, Multiply, Negative, Max, Min, Square, Sin, Cos, Tan, Abs
* We are not allowed to use tournament selection algorithms so we chose SPEA2.
* We split into 2 teams:
** Team A: Mainly handles adjusting the evolutionary algorithm.
** Team B: Mainly handles preparing the slides for the presentation on Wednesday.
** I was assigned Team B.
*** I created the slide for Catboost.

* New Assignment:
** Each team needs to solve the Titanic Problem using GP, instead of ML, by coming up with an evolutionary algorithm.
*** Note: We are not allowed to use any build-in DEAP evolutionary algorithms.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* The team met on Google Meet from 5PM-6PM EST.
* Rishit had begun working on preprocessing the data and so he went over what he had done and his findings so far.
* '''Data Pre-Processing:'''
** We first begin by analyzing the data we are given to:
*** Identify what features highly correlate to the survival rate.
*** See what features are mostly missing or need to be dropped.
** The data showed that some features from the name column seem to affect the survival:
*** Example: The title, whether it's "Mr.", "Mrs", "Dr.", "Rev.", "Miss", and "Master".
** Similarly, the Cabin letter and the Ticket letter have similar effects.
** Then we fill all the age null values with the mean age.
* '''Training:'''
* For training, we experimented with 6 algorithms:
** CatBoost
** K Neighbors
** Neural Network
** Logistic Regression
** SVM
** Random Forest
* Each member did one of the 6, I handled CatBoost.
** Kaggle Score: 0.78229

== February 10, 2021 ==
'''Team Meeting/Lecture Notes:'''
* We were divided into sub-teams based on our Pareto ranks:
** I'm in sub-team 4.
* We were assigned the Titanic problem as the first group assignment.
** Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster - Kaggle.com.
** Predict whether a passenger survived or not.
** Each person needs a codominant algorithm.
** The team needs to work with a common dataset.
** My team and I made both a private Slack channel and a GroupMe group.

'''Team Meeting/Lecture Notes (For the February 3rd Lecture):'''
* What is an algorithm looking for in a mate?
* The lecture focuses on the translation of scores from evaluation into a fitness value:
** Genes w/ Scores -> Fitness Computation -> Genes w/ Fitness
* Gene Pool: the set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation.
** Genome: DNA/Genotypic description of an individual.
** Search Space: Set of all possible genome.
* Data Set:
** Positive Samples.
** Negative Samples.
** The data set goes into a classifier to get a confusion matrix.
* Maximization Measures:
** We want the sensitivity (TP/P) and the Specificity (TN/N) to get closer to 1.
* Minimization Measures:
** We want the FNR and the Specificity FPR to get closer to 0.
* Formulas:
** PPV = TP / (TP + FP) -> Bigger is better.
** FDR = FP / (TP +FP) - > Smaller is better.
** NPV = TN / (TN + FN) -> Bigger is better.
** ACC = (TP + TN) / (P + N) OR (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + FN TN) -> Bigger is better.
** Abbreviations:
*** PPV = Predictive Value.
*** FDR = False Discovery Rate.
*** NPV = Negative Predictive Value.
*** ACC = Accuracy.
* Objective Space:
** Each individual is evaluated using objective functions:
*** Mean Squared Error.
*** Cost.
*** Complexity.
*** '''True Positive Rate.'''
*** '''False Positive Rate.'''
** The score from the objective function gives each individual a point in space -> the phenotype of the individual. 
* Pareto Optimality:
** An individual is Pareto optimal if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives.
** All the Pareto individuals make up the Pareto Frontier.
** We drive selection by favoring Pareto individuals.
* Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II):
** Population is separated into non-domination ranks.
** A binary tournament is used to select individuals.
** Lower Pareto ranks >
