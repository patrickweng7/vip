'''Team Meeting Notes:'''

* Our elevator pitch: We are researching how we can improve EMADE’s performance on image processing tasks; this semester in particular we are looking at multi-class image classification. Using a baseline run of EMADE on the dataset we processed, success for us looks like seeing improvements in ROC and compared to the baseline run when evaluated independently and in combinations.

'''Sub Team Notes:'''

* Found another issue with the hyper feature code. hyperfeature code is not producing individual with the standalone tree when i use the chestxray data, but it worked when I used the image dataset in emade.
I get the error, 
 cv2.error: OpenCV(4.5.3) :-1: error: (-5:Bad argument) in function 'addWeighted'
 > Overload resolution failed:
 >  - src1 data type = 23 is not supported
 >  - Expected Ptr<cv::UMat> for argument 'src1

'''Sub Team Notes:'''

* I talked with Jason to understand why the issue below was happening, 
** The standalone tree script threw an error with 'TriState.STREAM_TO_FEATURES' in the tree, but it ran fine if I changed it to 'TriState.STREAM_TO_STREAM'.
* The Reason was because the the line 327 and 329 in GP_frameworks_helper were commented out and so the pset from `TriState.STREAM_TO_FEATURES` was not working. 
** [https://github.gatech.edu/amehra37/emade/blob/Hyperfeatures_Image_Proc/src/GPFramework/gp_framework_helper.py]

* I now opened the pull request for the Hyper-feature branch which the team will evaluate.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''

* I met with Max a 30 minutes before the meeting to fix an issue i was getting in running the standalone script.
* We figured that the error was because of unnecessary hyper parameters in the tree which looked like this with highlighted hyper-parameters, 
** ` NNLearner(ContrastSobelHyperfeature(ARG0, passTriState(TriState.STREAM_TO_FEATURES), passAxis(Axis.FULL), ''' 6, 7, 0.1 '''), OutputLayer(DropoutLayer(0.584087228573285, InputLayer())), 98, AdamOptimizer) `
* I changed it to this, 
** ` NNLearner(ContrastSobelHyperfeature(ARG0, passTriState(TriState.STREAM_TO_FEATURES), passAxis(Axis.FULL)), OutputLayer(DropoutLayer(0.584087228573285, InputLayer())), 98, AdamOptimizer) `

* This seem to resolve the issue with the tree but it revealed a weird thing. 
* The standalone tree script threw an error with 'TriState.STREAM_TO_FEATURES' in the tree, but it ran fine if I changed it to 'TriState.STREAM_TO_STREAM'.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Consideration: reprocess data to just have single label for train/test (if there are not too too many multi-label cases), look at distribution of labels to ensure this will produce enough data
* To get vector out: dump out the numpy array inside the evaluation method, reinstall GPFramework, and then run individual with database or standalone tree evaluator script

* I made progress with working on the standalone tree to test the hyper-feature.
* This is the tree I used which is took from one of Max's trees that he had evaluated and replace the primitive with mine.
** --- NNLearner(ContrastSobelHyperfeature(ARG0, passTriState(TriState.STREAM_TO_STREAM), passAxis(Axis.FULL)), OutputLayer(DropoutLayer(0.584087228573285, InputLayer())), 98, AdamOptimizer)) ---
* I initially got some mysql errors and figured it was because i was not running the pbsmysql.pbs script correctly and so my node was not running. So I moved the pbsmysql.pbs script in my ~ directory on pace and it worked fine.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* MidTerm Presentations

* NLP
** Simulating the Bi-DAF model by first creating a word embedding and obtaining an output based on the context of the word
** Using the SQUAD dataset from Stanford with 100,000 answered and 50,000 unanswered questions.
** Trying to get close to the SOTA which is an F1 of 93.214
** Haven’t completed all the primitives yet such as the output layer which is why they do not have any results yet.
** Planning on using Facebook’s dataset. Dynamic/Episodic memory is the best as of now.

* NAS
** Overall goal is to make EMADE competitive with VGG16 and other large structure architectures
** Objectives: minimize accuracy errors and number of parameters
** Used time stopping of 600 vs 2500 seconds, latter ended in 1500 but generated less valid individuals and slightly better accuracy error (-0.05)
** Higher number of layers → higher num of error individuals (though 2-5 was less than baseline)
** Used only dense layers and convoluted layers
** Tracking layer frequencies across generations
** Created NNLearner table to track NNLearner individuals’ statistics

* Stocks
** Objectives: use EMADE for regression on time series data and optimize market trading algorithm ; beat SOTA using EMADE
**They are trying to model papers and use technical indicators to predict price change points
** Best primitives to use: modelled TI’s versus the different regression techniques that are implemented
**Maximize profit percentage and average profit per transaction, minimize CDF of profit and variance of profit per transaction (four obj functions total)
** Best performance was with the least complex tree (only one TI)
**They are using minimization rather than maximization functions since they work better on EMADE.

* Modularity
** Goal: allow search function to consider larger subtrees depth. Improve ARL candidate selection through a new weighting function (occurrences * ARL size / fitness of individual)
** Runs with both the old ARL’s and newer ARL’S are worse than with no ARL’s
** More data is needed to see effects of ARL complexity on performance
** Using ARLs with Stocks
*** Used various technical indicators
*** Problems with Google Colab’s limited computing power and merging stocks’ codebase into the ARL codebase
*** Individuals not evaluating because of cachev2 updates
** ARL: adaptive representation through learning
*** ARL’s are implemented between the genetic operations and the evaluation phase
*** Must be a complete tree
*** It basically abstracts away complexity

* Here are our Midterm Presentation slides: [https://github.gatech.edu/mkaneria3/VIP-FALL2021-ImageProcessing/blob/master/Image%20Processing%20Midterm%20Presentation.pdf]
** I worked on the Hyperfeature slides.

* Max tested PACE and it works, though primitives are erroring out for the nn tree
* Code not using nsga3, nsga2 is hard-coded
** Need to register nsga3 into toolbox
** Call it in the code

* We have four changes from the baseline, test all of them SEPARATELY
** Geo. Crossover
** Semantic Crossover
** Hyper Features
** NSGA-3 selection
** Compare which of these four had the best changes

* I worked on getting the hyper-feature code on emade as a primitive and Heidi decided to set up pace, fix any issues and get it ready for a run of emade for hyper-features.

* Presentation is NEXT WEEK!
* When doing runs:
** CPU hours should add up to how much time is left in the class
** 1 master - 1 core is constant
** Number of hosts means how many worker jobs
** Number of CPU per worker is core count per worker
* With all these different parameter tweaks, give thought to how will we show that we made improvement.

* I combined my code(contrast enhancement) with Heidi's code(edge detection filter).
* I also tested the code locally.

** Reason: we have multi-label data, traditional accuracy metrics do not work.
* Focus now: what we added is working correctly and generate comparison data (baseline data almost done)
* Anything put in the shared folder counts against personal quota (based on file ownership), Zutty can change it to his account and make it read-only
** We will test if we can do this with a conda environment
** Possibly database as well!

* I found a paper that I shared with Heidi and we came up with the idea of our hyper-feature.
* We decided to make a grey level transformation primitive to increase the contrast of each of the images. 
* Then make a primitive for edge detector filter and combine them. 
* This will make a good primitive combination because the increased contrast will help in improving the edge detection.

* We split up the work. 
** I decided to code the grey level transform – contrast enhancement primitive.

* Here is the link to the paper that we got the idea from : [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236125496_Image_processing_and_recognition_for_biological_images]

'''Final Presentations''' 
*Stocks Team:
** Paper: Piecewise Linear Representation, a graph of prices segmented in piecewise segments.
** Technical indicators: VWAP, VWMA, FIBRET
** Did 2 EMADE runs, with 328 generation 
** Used a new metric called buy/sell lag: difference between the local extrema and buy/sell point.

*NLP:
** Issue of getting trivial solutions in the neural nets.
** Solved it by the use of simpler datasets that can give a seeded network which can then be improved by EMADE.
** They solved many MySQL problems.
** They used the Amazon product review dataset with 22 generations and seeded individuals. They had good results with it, with the accuracy of the best individual being 93%.
** Next semester: get EMADE to run with unseeded runs.

*Modularity:
** Uses Adaptive representation through learning.
** They are dynamically evolved functions that can be used by other functions.
** Found super individuals that outperformed all other models.
** They would like to create new models like CNN architecture with decreasing learning rate in future.

'''Sub-Team Notes:'''
* Final review of the presentation slides to make sure everything is covered and is accurate.
* made a rough estimate of timings on each slide to make sure that we are within the time range of 20 -30 mins.

'''Personal Notes:'''
* I implemented the code to find the best combination of parameters in the in the parameter search problem.
** The best combination and the corresponding fitness value for it is outputted in a text file in the output directory of that universe.
** Here is the final code for the parameter search problem - [https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/blob/feature/Issue168-ParameterSearch-MONIL/parameter_search.py ParameterSearch]
* I cleaned up the code and pushed the final version on GitHub.
** Here is the link to the final branch for parameter_search problem.

'''Team-Meeting Notes:'''
* Updates on the work done by each sub-team.
* Final Presentation on April 30th at 6pm

'''Sub-Team Notes:'''
* Went over the completed slides for the final presentation and made edits where necessary. 
*Decided to make final changed that were discussed by Thursday, which would be the final sub-team meeting before the presentation.

'''Personal Notes:'''
* I finished my slides on the paper overview.
** Here is the [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mtGCykBN52kmu4_1CEU6biCzT6vh4JXiurjlzDSZJrI/edit?usp=sharing link] to the slides I made. ( Note: This is not the full presentation, only the slides I made.)
* Other than the slides I also worked on the parameter search problem.
** I changed the organization of the code by shifting the functionality of the main() method in main.py to the parameter_search.py file. 
*** I did this to make the code more readable as there was no need to call the main() from main.py and the same functionality could be achieved by doin it within the parameter_search.py file.
** I implemented the code that would organize the file system in the outputs directory of ezCGP to accommodate for storing different parameter combination outputs in separate directories.
*** Below is a screenshot showing an example output directory file organization.

'''Personal Notes:'''
* I worked on the parameter search problem.
* I met with Lucas Zhang on a bluejeans call to discuss the work. 
** we also had Rodd join us for some time so that he could give us a quick walk through of the skeleton file and how it was connected with the problem file.
* I came up with 2 main tasks to do related to the problem. 
** 1) Creating a new output file structure that would save the generations in an organized way, so that each different combination of population size and genome size are saved in a separate directory.
** 2) implementing a way to get the best fitness values of each combination and outputting the best parameter combination according to the fitness values.

* We started to work on the final presentation slides.
* Made a quick outline of the topics we wanted to cover and assigned each person with the slides they would present.

'''Personal Notes:'''
* I was assigned to the slides on the overview and description of the Crossover research paper that we read last week.
* Other than the slide, I made some progress in the parameter search problem.
** I talked with Lucas Zhang, who was assigned similar problem to mine to understand the problem better and we also talked about potential implementations that we could make.

'''Personal Notes:'''
*I finished doing the code implementation for the NGUYEN7 symbolic regression problem that I was. assigned last week.
* I also pushed the code for the the NGUYEN7 problem on branch "[https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/tree/feature/SymbolicRegression-MONIL feature/SymbolicRegression-MONIL]" on the ezCGP repo.
* I made a new brach for the parameter search problem named "feature/Issue168-ParameterSearch-MONIL"
** I went over the code skeleton provided by Rodd for the parameter search problem to better understand what it was doing.
*** parameter_search.py is cousin script to main.py which can run the symbolic regression problem files with different combinations of parameters that we can specify.
*** The goal is to search for the combination of parameters that produces the best fitness.
**** In this file I focused on the combinations of 4 different population sizes and 3 different genome sizes.

'''Personal notes:'''
* Titanic ML assignment:
** I was focusing on  minimizing the false positives in the titanic dataset.
** I explored several models to achieve the best results.
** Some of the models tried to use were,
*** Gradient Boosting Classifier
*** Decision Tree Classifier
*** K Nearest Neighbors
*** Random Forest Classifier
*** Gaussian NB
*** MLPC Classifier
** I created plots for several parameters in the range of some values to see where I got the best accuracy.
** Finally, I achieved the best result with the Decision Tree Classifier by setting the max_depth parameter to 4.
*** Accuracy = 82.37%
*** FP = 20, FN = 33
** Here is a link to [https://github.gatech.edu/mkaneria3/VIP_sp21_SubTeam3/blob/master/Titanic%20ML/example.ipynb my notebook].

'''Lab 2:'''
* Genetic Programing lab
** Genetic programming is an evolutionary approach to generating computer programs. 
** individual class inherits from DEAP's PrimitiveTree class instead of a list.
* Initialization of tree stucture
** I added mod and abs value as 2 extra primitive methods
*** pset.addPrimitive(np.mod, arity=2)
*** pset.addPrimitive(np.absolute, arity=1)
* An evolution function is defined.
* for the mutation function, I chose gp.mutNodeReplacement.
** with this the algorithm reached the min faster.
* The evaluation function is run and the graph of the results is plotted.
* 
* Multi-Objective Genetic Programming
** New fitness and individual classes for a multi objective problem are created.
** Three new primitives are added to the primitive set
*** sine, cosine, and tangent.
** This problem will not be solved within 100 iterations.
** The  pareto dominance function is defined.
** Pareto dominance function returns true if the first individual dominates the second individual.
** 300 random individuals and 1 separate individual for comparison are initialized.
** The population is sorted by pareto dominance in comparison to the separate individual previously defined.
** The main evolutionary function is run.
** The graph to visualize the objective space and pareto front is plotted.[[files/Pareto front lab2.png|thumb|331x331px]]

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
** Gene Pool - a set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation.
** Genome
*** Genotypic description of an individual
*** DNA
*** GA - set of values
*** PF - tree structure
** Search space
*** Set of all possible genome
** Objective Space
*** The Evaluation of a Genome associates a genome/individual with a set of scores.
*** True Positive -TP
**** How often are we identifying the desired object?
*** False Positive - FP
**** How often are we identifying something else as the desired object
*** Objectives
**** Set of measurements each genome (or individual) is scored against
**** Phenotype
*** Objective space - Set of objectives.
** Classification Measures
*** Dataset -> Classifier -> Confusion Matrix
** Maximization Measures
*** Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TRP)
**** TRP = TP/P = TP/(TP+FN)
*** Specificity (SPC) or True Negative Rate (TNR)
**** TNR = TN/N = TN/(TN+FP)
** Minimization Measures
*** False Negative Rate (FNR)
**** FNR = FN/P = FN/(TP+FN)
*** Fallout or False Positive Rate (FPR)
**** FPR = FP/N = TN/(FP+TN)
**** FPR = 1- TNR = 1 - SPC
** Other Measures
*** Precision or Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
**** PPV = TP / (TP + FP)
*** False Discovery Rate
**** FDR = FP/(TP + FP)
**** FDR = 1 - PPV
*** Negative Predictive Value (NPV)
**** NPV = TN / (TN + FN)
*** Accuracy (ACC)
**** ACC = (TP+TN) / (P+N)
**** ACC = (TP+TN) / ( TP + FP + FN + TN)
** Objective Space
*** Each individual is evaluated using objective functions
*** Objective scores give each individual a point in objective space
*** This may be referred to as the phenotype of the individual
** Pareto Optimality
*** An individual is Pareto optimal if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives
*** Pareto frontier
**** The set of all Pareto individuals

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Genetic Programming
** The individual is a function itself.
** Individual is fed data and it outputs the output data.
** Tree Representation
*** Nodes are called primitives
*** Leaves are called terminals
*** Input passes through the leaves
*** Output comes out through the root
*** How is the tree stored?
**** Three is converted to lisp preordered parse tree.
**** Example:
***** F(x) = 3*4+1 is stored as [+, *, 3, 4, 1]
***** F(x) = 2-(0+1) is stored as [-, 2, +, 0, 1]
***** F(x) = [2- [(3*4)+1] is stored as [-, 2, +, *, 3, 4, 1]
***** This comes from the root and expands
** Crossover/mating in GP
*** Crossover in tree-based GP is done by exchanging subtrees
** Mutation in GP
*** Insert a node or a subtree
*** Delete a node or a subtree
*** Change a node
** Example - Symbolic Regression
*** Evolve a solution to y = sin(x)
*** Primitives include:
**** +, *, -, /
*** Terminals include
**** x
*** Taylor series for sin(x)
**** For 3rd order:
***** X = x - x^3/3!
**** [-, input1, input2]
**** [-, x, / input3, input4]
**** [-, x, /, *, input5, input6, *, input7, input8]
**** …
*** Evaluating the tree
**** Feed inputs
**** Run F(x)
**** Measure error between outputs and truth
'''Lab 1 Notes:'''
* One Max Problem
** Goal - get a list that contains all 1s
** Individual - a list randomly containing 0s and 1s  of a fixed size (here 100)
** Evaluation - the total number of 1s in an individual
*** Calculated by checking if sum(list) == size(list)
** Mating - used two point cross over
** Mutation - flipped random bits
** Selection - used tournaments
** Achievement - optimal solution is mostly achieved within the first 40 generations, but the algorithm fails some times.
* N-queens Problem
** Goal - get a configuration of N queens in a NxN chess board such that no queen is capturing any other queen.
** Individual - configuration of a NxN chess board containing N queens.
** Evaluation - checking if any queen is capturing any other queen.
** Mating - used partially matched crossovers
** Mutation - used shuffling of indices.
*** Replacements of indices is not used in this problem because we don’t want the new indices to go out of range from the NxN dimensions of the chess board.
** Selection - used tournaments
** Achievement - optimal solution is mostly reached 100 generations, but occasionally it fails.
** My edits - I tired to tweak the mutation parameters.
*** I changed the range of the mutation loop from size to size/2 to mutated only half of the individual.
**** This did not improve the result.
**** The max value started to converge more towards zero, but the min value was still randomly reaching zero sometimes and not reaching the other times.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Genetic Algorithms:
** Each new generation is created through mating/mutation of individuals in the previous population. 
** Their fitness is evaluated. 
** Through numerous operations of this process, it will eventually produce the best individual.
* Important Definitions:
** Individual: one specific candidate in the population.
** Population: group of individuals whose properties will be altered. 
** Objective: a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize.
** Fitness: relative comparison to other individuals; how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to the rest of the population? 
** Evaluation: a function that computes the objective of an individual.
** Selection: selecting the best individual.
*** Fitness Proportionate: Individual with the best fitness is selected.
*** Tournament: several tournaments among individuals are held and the winner is selected.
** Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
** Mutate: introduces random modifications; purpose is to maintain diversity
* General Flow of this Algorithm:
*# Randomly initialize population
*# Determine fitness of population
*# Repeat…
*## select parents from population
*## perform crossover on parents creating population
*## perform mutation of population
*## determine fitness of population
*# … until best individual is good enough.
* One Max Problem:
** This problem begins with individuals that each has a list of one hundred values that are either 0 or 1.
** The goal is to eventually produce an individual whose list contains ALL one’s.
