'''Progress made:'''
* Installed jupyter notebook and deap
*Joined slack
*Ran all the code for the One Max Problem in Lab 1
**The code essentially made 300 individuals (lists of 100 0s and/or 1s) in a population, mated the individuals, mutated the offspring, and repeated for 40 generations
**I noticed that the later generations had higher statistics (min, max, and avg)
**An individual composed of all 1s was reached

== January 11, 2019 ==
'''Progress made:'''
*Ran all the code for the N Queens Problem in Lab 1
**The code minimized the number of conflicts on the diagonal of a chessboard of queens
**I noticed that the later generations had lower statistics (min, max, and avg)
**The evolution was successful (a board with no conflicts was reached)
**The given mutation function shuffled queens randomly
***Here is the graph associated with the given mutation: 
*[[files/chessimage2.jpg|300x300px]]
**I made a mutation function that shifted the queens along the board, moving the queen in the last column up to the first
***Here is the graph associated with my mutation:
*[[files/Chessimage.jpg|300x300px]]
**Initially, I was unable to see the graph after running the code so I saved it using plt.savefig() instead

== January 14, 2019 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Sub-teams gave short scrum reports from the wiki
* GP: Genetic Programming Lecture notes:
**GA review: evaluation, fitness computation, selection, mating, mutation
**Individuals in GA were lists (genome) of genes
**Our genome for GP is a tree
***Output=root (at the top)
***Leaves at the end of tree (terminals, typically inputs)
***Nodes in the middle (primitives, typically fcts)
**Parse trees
**Single point crossover: switch chunks of two trees
**Mating is usually a single point crossover
**Single point mutation (switching primitive sign)
**Insertion mutation
**Shrink node mutation
**Symbolic regression
**You can add primitives to make things more simple

'''Progress made:'''
* I ran the code for the first part of the lab, but when I added primitives, I got graphs that didn't look right
** I plan to go to office hours to figure out what's wrong
**Update: I went to OH but no one was there
* The graph below is the result of me running the code with adding any additional primitives
*[[files/FitnessVSgeneration1-page-001.jpg|350x350px]]
* The graph below is the result of me running the code with my addition of the following primitives:
** floor divide
** positive
*[[files/FitnessVSgeneration2-page-001.jpg|350x350px]]
*The fitness of a population is determined by how well the function compiled from our primitive produces results compared to what the actual function predicts
**We are trying to minimize the mean squared error
== January 28, 2019 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Scrum reports from sub-teams
* Powerpoint on Multiple Objects
**What do you look for in a mate?
***funny, smart, nice, etc.
**What would a genetic algorithms look for in a mate?
***accuracy, efficiency, size, etc.
**Key terms:
{| class="wikitable"
!-Genome

-Search space

-Objectives

-Objective space
!-Evaluation

-True positive (TP)

-False positive (FP)

-True negative (TN)

-False negative (FN)

* We made a confusion matrix to determine how well the function that the girls in the room had black hair
*Maximization Measures: Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR), Specificity(SPC)orTrue Negative Rate (TNR)
*Minimization Measures: False Negative Rate (FNR), Fallout or False Positive Rate (FPR)
*An individual is Pareto if it outperforms all other individuals on all objectives

'''Progress Made'''
* I completed the second part of Lab 2
*I generated the following three graphs when I ran the code:
*[[files/Objective Space.jpg|300x300px]]
*[[files/Generation vs Fitness.jpg|300x300px]]
*[[files/Pareto Front.jpg|300x300px]]
*I had to adjust the scaling of the axes and exclude some outliers to get a clear image of the data
*The area under the curve of the third graph determines the quality of the Pareto Front
**smaller area=better Pareto front
*The first area UTC I got was 2.463792426733847
*I reduced this to 0.6912744703006891 by deleting some of the primitives
*The last section of the lab covers strongly typed genetic programming, ephemeral constants, and bloat control
**Ephemeral constants aren't predefined values, rather terminals generated by a function
**To prevent trees from becoming to large over time, you can set limits on their heights

*we tried using version 5.7 of mySQL instead of 8.0 but that didn't work
*We also checked to see if my firewall was blocking the information but my firewall wasn't turned on
*I hope to get some help from Jason on Monday
== February 24, 2019 ==
'''Progress Made:'''
*I'm still getting the network error
*A different error occurred when I ran it on my local host
**Jason recommended that I comment out a line of code, reinstall, and lower the evaluation parameters to try to get through more generations
**This fixed the error

'''Update:'''
*I spilled tea on my laptop and had to get it sent in for repair
*My hard drive was replaced so I'm basically starting from scratch installing Emade

**The different functions for making graphs are under scripts
**It's laid out in a way where it's pretty easy to make a new graph

"Notes on git:"
*A Git repository is the .git/ folder inside a project that tracks all changes made to files in your project
*To add a file to the repo, use the touch command
**ex- touch filename.txt
*ls in the terminal will list all the files in a folder
*the git status command shows which files git knows exist
*you have to use 'git add' with new files
*A commit is a record of what files you have changed since the last time you made a commit
**really helpful bc it allows you to go back to any state of the project
**to make a commit, run the command git commit -m "your message"
*Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project
**Run <code>git checkout -b <my branch name></code>
*git branch shows you all the branches for your projects with an Asterix next to the one you're currently pointed at
*GitHub allows multiple people to work on a project
**to push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, run git push origin yourbranchname or git push git.github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname
*A pull request (or PR) is a way to alert a repo's owners that you want to make some changes to their code
*If you're an owner of a repo you may not need to create a PR to merge changes
*To merge, press the green 'merge pull request' button on GItHub
**if the button is grey, there is a merge conflict
**after merging, you should delete your branch for organizational purposes
**double check that your commits were merged by clicking on the 'commits' link on repo homepage
***here you can also see the hash code which is a unique identifier for that specific commit 
****to undo changes use the command git revert <hash code number>
*to get the most recent changes that you or others have merged on GitHub, use the <code>git pull origin master</code> command
**you can then use git log to see the new commits
Note: The mysql links contain A LOT of info and I should check back whenever I'm using mysql and don't know what command to use in the terminal
==April 15, 2019==
"Meeting Notes:"
*Met with Bek and Gabe
*We fixed the pickle_caching code
**There were mostly just small typos
*Made a pull request to merge with the master
*Only the Pareto Front graph generates a pickle file
*My computer has some trouble loading the dataset but I think it's just something weird with my computer... it worked fine on Bek and Gabe's computers
*We also noticed that Emade viz looks a little weird on chrome
*I got to put some of my new git skills to use:)

"LAST ENTRY"
*Today was the final presentation meeting
*Overall, I really enjoyed being part of this VIP this semester
*I learned a lot about machine learning and genetic programming and was challenged in a different way than I would have been in a typical class
*Some feedback I got from the midterm review was that I have a great notebook but I could have more detailed to-dos and more links to my work.  I tried to continue taking descriptive notes throughout the second half of the semester and incorporating more links when appropriate.  Also, whenever I had a task I made sure to note of it in an action table.
*I think I deserve an A because I put in a lot of effort throughout the semester.  For example, I met with James outside of class several times to get Emade running, and I took a position of leadership while tackling the titanic problem.  When I joined the VIZ sub team, I did independent research in order to implement caching in the app's code.  All in all, I came in with minimal knowledge on machine learning and genetic programming, but I didn't let this hold me back, rather I tried to soak up as much knowledge as possible.
*Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity!
