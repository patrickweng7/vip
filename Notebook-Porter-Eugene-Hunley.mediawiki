* Decided on creating a .csv for an individual and having draw.io make the diagram.
* Created the basic [https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/commit/1342519e457e7e7d89bc63b573a0cfdb0d932e23 visualizer] that would later be expanded on.
* Messed around with Draw.io to see how different parts of the csv would affect the diagram.
