'''<u>Concept of Genetic Algorithms</u>'''
*new generation created through mating/mutation of individuals
*fitness is evaluated then used again for new generation
**relative comparison to other individuals (Ex. how well does individual accomplish task relative to population?)

'''<u>Keywords</u>'''
*Objective: value used to characterize individuals (usually maximize objective)
*Selection: gives preference to better individuals therefore allowing them to pass on their genes
*Fitness Proportionate: greater the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected for mating
*Tournament: several tournaments among individuals; winners selected for mating
*Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
*Mutate: introduces random modifications; purpose to maintain diversity

'''<u>Algorithm</u>'''
#Randomly initialize population
#Determine fitness of population
#Repeat
##Select parents
##Perform crossover on parents
##Perform mutation
##Determine fitness of individuals

=== Lab 1 Notes: ===
'''One Max Problem'''
*Defined a fitness objective and individual classes with DEAP creator
*Defined individual as 100 boolean values and population as a list of individuals
**Evaluation function is just the sum of the ones
*Defined genetic operators such as mutate, mate, and tournament
*Start the main algorithm
**Evaluate each individual in population and map fitness with individual
**Select individuals for tournament
**Mate and mutate individuals with 50% and 20% chance respectively
**Re-evaluate fitness of new individuals and assign fitness to individuals
*Main algorithm was run 40 times to achieve best result

'''N Queens Problem'''
*Problem: Placing n queens on a nxn board so that none of the queens hit each other
*This time the weight of our fitness objective is negative since we want to minimize the number of conflicts between queens on the chessboard
*Defined a permutation function in the toolbox to represent locations of queens on the chessboard
*Defined evaluation function to count conflicts between other queens
**Since queens are placed on different rows and columns because of permutation, only need to check diagonals
**There are 2*n - 1 diagonals left and 2*n - 1 right
*Tested out two-point crossover function would two randomized permutations of 1-8
*Defined our mutation function as a shuffle function since we cannot change any of the numbers since they represent column values on board
**Made my own mutation function switching first and last if probability lower than indpb
