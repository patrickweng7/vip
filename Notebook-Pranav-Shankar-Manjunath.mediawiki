*** Four Runs Left
**** Trials 2 and 3 of Loss, Variance, and Avg. Loss
**** Trials 2 and 3 of Loss, CDF, and Avg. Loss
* Completed Final Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NEBKzjTDcTHCosAotFKmvSSGbmRxxeedptpNviGxse8/edit?usp=sharing

''' Individual Notes: '''
* Presented Overarching and Short-term Objectives like in Midterm presentation
* Presented Experiment Design and Focus
** Goal was to beat paper and TS Fuzzy (SOTA) results
** Needed to determine how EMADE objective sets affect the overall performance of Pareto Individuals on a constant objective

'''Team Notes:'''
* In our Friday meeting, Dr. Zutty recommended that we negate the loss percentage output, converting it to profit percentage (since loss percentage is negative profit percentage), thus making our values more readable and understandable. As such, we also need to reverse the color scale to match the change to the opposite sign.

''' Team Notes: '''
* Began EMADE runs with Avg Loss, Loss, Variance of Profit Per Transaction (VPPT), and CDF as well as implemented changes from last week (implemented constraint of Loss Percentage)
** Produced significantly better individuals (5860 valid in first-run vs 200 valid combined in all previous runs)
* Began to work on the box plots that Dr. Zutty suggested last week.

'''Individual Notes:'''
* Re-iterated my suggestion from a few weeks prior that we remove Error as an objective in our EMADE runs.
** Initially, my reasoning was based on reducing redundancy with Avg. Loss and Variance already being used as objectives in our runs, but then I shifted my reasoning to the fact that Error is the only objective that doesn't use Profit values as part of its calculation and Profit is important for us so that we can compare to SOTA (TS Fuzzy).

''' Team Notes: '''
* Dr. Zutty recommended a strategy of a similar type that I suggested the previous week.
** He suggested constraining one objective to provide a basis for comparison between different EMADE runs.
*** We ended up going with the same objective I mentioned. We constrained loss percentage because of its usefulness in comparison.
** Dr. Zutty also suggested that we can compare runs using a box plot of the Pareto individuals which would enable us to find the best runs based on Median and IQR.

''' Individual notes: '''
* Modified experiment design to reflect our new strategy of constraining loss percentage for comparison between EMADE runs.

''' Team Notes: '''
* Abhi started the EMADE runs with the narrowed-down list of objectives.
** See Individual Notes for more information
* Dr. Zutty suggested turning our objectives into minimization objectives as EMADE handles those better
* Discussed ways to compare EMADE runs
** See Individual Notes for more information

''' Individual Notes: '''
* I narrowed down the list of objectives to Profit Percentage, Average Profit Per Transaction, Variance of Profit Per Transaction, and CDF of Profit Distribution based on our emphasis on the importance of Profit as a tool for SOTA comparison analysis (TS Fuzzy)
* Suggested keeping loss-percentage constant across all runs so as to have a comparison point for analyzing discrepancies among EMADE RUNS...Team agreed.

''' Team Notes: '''
* Tested Best results from Spring 2022 Semester against TS Fuzzy Paper based on the profit from our top-performing individual Learner(MyBollingerBand(ARG0, 2, 61, falseBool), LearnerType('DECISIONTREE_REGRESSION', None), EnsembleType('SINGLE', None)) which looked for a change of 61 standard deviations across 2 days
** Discovered that overall profit compared well against TS Fuzzy, but per-stock profit performance was poor compared to the paper

** [[files/rbhat3/last_sem_performance.png|thumb|50x50px]]
* TS Fuzzy Paper Code Performance
** [[files/rbhat3/this_sem_performance.png|thumb|50x50px]]
*** Found that given individual was optimized for stocks from previous paper instead of stocks presented in TS-Fuzzy Paper
* TS Fuzzy Model Performance - Previous Year's results currently better but we are currently performing worse
** [[files/rbhat3/paper_perf.png|thumb|50x50px]]
* Abhi's Sanity Check Code: https://github.gatech.edu/rbhatnager3/emade/blob/stocks-pace/testCode/stocks/notebooks/paper_recreation%20(1).ipynb
* Rishi changed the PLR code to use the Adjusted Close Prices instead of the Close price, making our graphs much more akin to the desired results, with the exception of the spike around Day 40-50.
* Working on Midterm Presentation
** Design of Experiments
*** Decided to run EMADE on PACE-ICE
**** Wall Time: 8
**** CPUs/Host: 8
**** Hosts: 3
*** Trying to figure out how to streamline the process by performing multiple EMADE runs in parallel
*** See Individual Notes for a compiled list of sets of objectives for EMADE runs

''' Individual Notes: '''
* Team agreed with my suggestion that we complete EMADE runs with different sets of objectives.
* Here is the initial list of objective sets that I compiled for the EMADE runs
** 2 Objectives
*** (Loss, CDF), (Loss, Variance), (Loss, Error), (CDF, Variance), (CDF, Error), (Variance, Error), (Avg Loss, Loss), (Avg Loss, Variance), (Avg Loss, Error), (Avg Loss, CDF)
** 3 Objectives
***  (Loss, CDF, Variance), (Loss, CDF, Error), (Loss, Variance, Error), (CDF, Variance, Error), (Avg Loss, CDF, Loss), (Avg Loss, CDF, Variance), (Avg Loss, CDF, Error), (Avg Loss, Loss, Variance), (Avg Loss, Variance, Error), (Avg Loss, Loss, Error),
** 4 Objectives
*** (Loss, CDF, Variance, Error), (Avg Loss, CDF, Variance, Error), (Avg Loss, Variance, Error, Loss), (Avg Loss, Error, Loss, CDF), (Loss, Avg Loss, Variance, CDF)
* After compiling the full list and seeing how many runs we'd have to, as well as taking into account the compute time of PACE-ICE with the number of hosts, workers per host, and wall time available, I suggested that we significantly cut down on the number of runs we do by cutting out one or two objectives.
** Suggested cutting down one of Loss, Avg Loss, or Variance to reduce redundancy, also recommended including Profit so as to provide more effective SOTA comparison (TS Fuzzy)

''' Team Notes: '''
* Abhi developed a sanity check on the PLR methods but we are still unable to get the same profit values and are unable to identify a real pattern that would hint as to the cause of the differences.
** After discussing with Dr. Zutty, we discovered that the PLR methods that we have created are not matching those in the paper.
*** We could focus our research to focus the same exact results as those in the TS Fuzzy Paper, but this would reduce the significance of autoML and EMADE and focus more on the financial side of things.
*** Our other choice was to continue debugging our existing code as much as possible and utilize EMADE regardless of our ability to reproduce the results. We are already receiving similar patterns in our buy/trade signals, and this allows us to focus on the Machine Learning aspect of our project more.
* We also discussed how to go about presenting the results of our research in our midterm presentation.
''' Individual Notes: '''
* Investigated the PLR-SVR model delineated in the TS Fuzzy Paper. Rishi suggested reviewing the calculation of the Euclidean Distance to see if it was causing any issues, but when investigating it Sriram and I both discovered that it was being computed correctly algebraically.
* Based on our Timeline, I suggest we complete a multitude of EMADE trials with varying sets of 2, 3, and 4 objectives

'''Team Notes:'''
* We decided to use more Genetic Programming.
** Designed EMADE trials as a group to figure out the best configuration produce the best results possible.
*** Eval Functions being used:
**** APPT, VPPT, PP, CDF Profit Dist, Tree Size, MSE, MAE
** Dr. Zutty suggested creating and implementing the paper outside of EMADE as a sanity check and to continue if our results successfully match.
** Rishi noted that our Profit calculation will be slightly different for us because we don't calculate tax rate.
* Discovered that the TS-Fuzzy paper individually optimized the technical indicators on a stock-by-stock basis, instead of grouping the stocks together and creating a single unified model that optimizes the technical indicators together. I note that this is inefficient as running singular trials sequentially takes too much time.

'''Team Notes:'''
* Added Sriram Mudireddy to our team
* Replicating the results of the TS Fuzzy Paper:
** Created a new branch [https://github.gatech.edu/rbhatnager3/emade/tree/stocks-pace stocks-pace] to track this semester's progress
** [https://github.gatech.edu/rbhatnager3/emade/tree/49134ca36c0d45aabd32b139172aaadfe988c73f] demonstrates our recent progress
*** Moved away from exponential smoothing for finding the Buy/Sell signals to a fixed threshold bound calculated from the mean and SD of the training labels
*** Changed Training Stocks: Previous paper used AAPL, BA, VZ, UMC, and AUO. Current paper uses AAPL, BA, VZ, CAT, JNJ, XOM, and S&P500
**** More optimal because TS Fuzzy Paper uses American Stocks only
*** I changed the optimal PLR threshold calculation to match the paper's values (between 0.5(SD of price data) and 1.0(SD of price data)), diverging from last semester's brute force genetic algorithm.
** Issues: Abhiram pointed out that a main part of the paper involved using TS Fuzzy Rule-based models to identify the buy/sell signals after the test data is predicted with the Support Vector Regression. Will discuss with Dr. Zutty in our next meeting which will be virtual since Fall Break is coming.

=== Subteam Notes: ===
* Ran EMADE one more time
* <b>I spent most of the past week researching Technical Indicators</b>
** TA-Lib Indicators
*** STOCH_RSI - measure of RSI relative to itself (high-low range over a time period)
*** AROON - identifies whether a price is trending or within a trading range
**** AROONUP - measures length of time since last price high
**** AROONDOWN - measures length of time since last price low
*** ADX - used to determine the strength of a particular trend, makes use of +, - DIs
*** OBV - indicates degree of momentum, measures buying/selling pressure cumulatively and adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days. The actual value of OBV is irrelevant but it is important to pay attention to its direction and trend.
**** <b>Implemented OBV with Abhiram and Rishi's assistance</b>
** Non TA-Lib Indicators
*** VWMA (Volume Weighted Moving Average) - prices weighted based on “volume” of trading activity during a particular time period
**** 3-Day VWMA is calculated by multiplying each day’s volume by that same day’s closing price, adding all three combined values together and dividing by the total volume across the three days. (C1*V1 + C2*V2 + C3*V3) / (V1 + V2 + V3)
*** VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) - average price weighted by volume
**** Compute typical price ((H + L + C)/ 3), multiply by period’s volume, create a running total of these values and of volume
**** Calculated by dividing the running total of price-volume by the running total of volume
*** Fibonacci Retracement - used to set price targets, for technical analysis of stocks
**** 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, 78.6% (50% and 100% are also used although not technically Fibonacci ratios)

* <b>With regard to the paper, I asked the team to explain Exponential Smoothing to me in a more detailed manner
** Went into detail about time-series data, forecasting, and prediction intervals</b>
<b>Statistics</b>
* Data is collected on several metrics
* A/B testing is an option
* Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation are important values
* Hypothesis testing: Mean + SD
* T-tests + p-values
** t-table, n-1 degrees of freedom
** p <= 0.05 --> observations are good
** Welch's T-test/Unequal Variance T-test
*** Test the hypothesis that two populations have equal means
*** Probability that both samples came from the same area
*** Utilized in finding out whether our changes resulted in any difference in our EMADE runs
** Ultimately, the greater the T-statistic, the less likely the given sample is observed with our hypothesis
* Apply tests to our sttocks
* Percentage --> random variable
* Problem: Lack of a normal distribution with our current 5 stocks
* Run EMADE again before Thursday's meeting

== Feb 17th, 2021 - Feb 23rd, 2021 ==

=== Team Meeting/Lecture Notes: ===
* Discussed Titanic Skaggle Assignment
* Titanic Genetic Programming Assignment was introduced
** We were told not to use algorithms listed directly in the algorithm module in the DEAP library
** We were told not to use a tournament-selection algorithm

=== Subteam 4 Notes: ===
* Discussed what primitives, mutation functions, mating functions, and selection functions we would use
* <b>I discovered that square was the most helpful primitive in improving our accuracy and reducing AUC (I figured this out from Lab 2).
* I tried a couple of different Mutation Functions before settling on mutUniform
** Experimentation primarily relied on DEAP library-based reasoning along with experimenting with random mutation functions and mutation functions from previous labs that worked.
** I tried mutShrink because it's a function that's used mostly with large trees. Accuracy and AUC did not improve.
** I also attempted to use mutNodeReplacement. Accuracy improved marginally but AUC increased. This was a function that was used in a previous lab and I thought it might work.
** I tried to use mutEphemeral. I saw marginal improvement but decided against using it because it did not utilize our expr function and I wasn't sure that modifying the constants of the tree individual was the right way to go.
** Ultimately I ended up using mutUniform. I thought it was a good choice because not only did both Accuracy and AUC improve but I was able to utilize our expr function properly.</b>

* Utilized selBest and SPEA2 as our selection functions (we weren't allowed to use tournament selection)
* Ultimately we were able to lower our AUC and improve our accuracy a considerable amount

* Set up Group 4 specific Slack Channel and GroupMe
* Assignment was to clean [https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic Titanic Challenge] Project data and then run ML algorithms on it
** Each Team Member was supposed to come up with an ML algorithm that is co-dominant to other team members' chosen ML algorithms

=== Subteam 4 Notes: ===
* Team Lead is [https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/Notebook_Rishit_Mohan_Ahuja Rishit Ahuja]
* Found that Cabin Column had several null values (over 3/4 ~ 77%) so we removed it from our data
* Encoded categorical features
** For name, we used the name titles and the length of the name
** PClass had a -33% correlation with the survival rate. We label encoded it.
** Embarked was One Hot Encoded but eventually dropped
* Ticket Identifier
** Didn't correlate very well with Survival
** Used to generate features for ticket length similar to with name
** Used to generate feature that contained first ticket letter
* Swapped out NULL values with the feature's average value (calculated excluding the NULL values)
* Generated Confusion Matrix and calculated Accuracy for all 6 chosen algorithms
* <b>Personally Chosen Algorithm: Support Vector Machine
** Utilized Linear Kernel
** Achieved 0.8305084745762712 Accuracy</b>

=== Lecture 3: Multiple Objectives - The MO in MOGA and MOGP ===
* '''Genes'''
** Gene pool - the set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation
*** Genome - genotypic description of an individual's DNA
**** GA - set of values, GP - tree structure, string
*** Search Space
**** set of all possible genome, set of all possible algorithms
**** size is important
** Evaluation of a Genome - associates a genome with a set of scores
*** TP - True Positive
*** FP - False Positive
*** Objectives - set of measurements each genome is scored against - phenotype
**** Objective Space - set of objectives
*** Evaluation - Maps a genome/individual
**** Genotypic description - from a location in search space
**** Phenotypic description - to a location in objective space
*** Sensitivity - True Positive Rate
*** Specificity - True Negative Rate
* '''Objective Space'''
** Each individual is evaluated using objective functions
*** Mean Squared Error
*** Cost
*** Complexity
*** True Positive Rate
*** False Positive Rate
*** Etc.
** Objective scores give each individual a point in objective space
** May be referred to as the phenotype
* '''Pareto Optimality'''
** An individual is Pareto optimal if there's no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives
** Set of all Pareto individuals is known as the Pareto frontier
** These individuals represent unique contributions
** Pareto individuals should be favored in order to drive Natural Selection
*** But, maintain diversity by giving all individuals some probability of mating
* '''Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II)'''
** Population is separated into nondomination ranks
** Individuals are selected using a binary tournament
** Lower Pareto > Higher Pareto
** Ties are broken by crowding distance
*** Crowding Distance - summation of normalized Euclidean distances to all points within the front
*** Higher Crowding Distance > Lower Crowding Distance
* '''Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)'''
** Each individual is given a strength S - how many others in the population it dominates
** Each individual is given a rank R - the sum of S's of the individuals that dominate it
*** Pareto individuals are nondominated and receive an R of 0
** A distance to kth nearest neighbor is calculated (σk) and fitness of R + 1/(σk + 2) is obtained

=== Lab 2 - Genetic Programming and Multi-Objective Optimization, Multi-Objective Genetic Programming with Symbolic Regression: Results ===
* Goal was to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the size of our tree
'''Original Results'''
* Utilized exiting registered functions and didn't change any parameters
* Best individual is: negative(cos(multiply(add(cos(sin(cos(sin(cos(tan(x)))))), cos(x)), tan(x)))) with fitness: (0.2786133308027132, 15.0)
* AUC of Pareto Front Graph was 2.3841416372199005

[[files/Lab2part2graph1original.png|none|thumb]]
[[files/Lab2graph2original.png|none|thumb]]
'''Results after modifying mutation and select functions:'''
* Goal was to improve algorithm by reducing AUC by 25% or more -> AUC should be <= 1.788106228
* Changed mutation function from mutUniform to mutEphemeral with parameter mode = "all"
* Changed select function parameter tournsize from 3 to 4
* AUC of Pareto Front Graph was 1.0026141205075572, meaning the AUC was decreased by approximately 58%
* Best individual is: subtract(sin(x), add(x, cos(x))) with fitness: (0.4909135054438985, 7.0)

== Jan 27th, 2021 - Feb 2nd, 2021 ==

=== Lecture 2: Genetic Programming ===
* '''Concept'''
** Instead of taking an individual and having a function evaluator to contain objective scores, the individual is the function itself
* '''Tree Representation'''
** Program can be represented as a Tree structure
*** Nodes - primitive, represent functions
*** Leaves - terminals, represent parameters
**** Input = type of terminal
**** Output -> produced at the root of the tree
** How is the Tree Stored?
*** Converted to a lisp <u>preordered</u> parse tree - Operator followed by inputs
** Example 1
*** The tree for f(X) = 3 * 4 + 1 can be written as [+, *, 3, 4, 1]
**** Parse is written in pre-order but read in-order -> (3 *4) + 1
*** This comes from using the root first and then expanding
**** [+, input1, input2]
**** [+, *, input3, input4, 1]
**** [+, *, 3, 4, 1] [[files/Smalltree1.png|none|thumb]]
** Example 2
*** The tree for f(X) = 2 - (0 + 1) can be written as [-, 2, +, 0, 1] [[files/Smalltree2.png|none|thumb]]
* '''Crossover in GP'''
** Exchanging Subtrees
** Start by randomly picking a point in each tree
** These points and everything below them create subtrees
* '''Mutation in GP'''
** Insert, deleting, or changing a node/subtree
** Example: Symbolic Regression
** Primitives include: +, *, -, /
** Terminals include integers and: X
** Solution: Taylor series for sin(x)
** Third-order Expression: [-. x, /, *, x, *, x, x, *, 3, 2]
* '''Evaluating a Tree'''
** Feed inputs into function and calculate difference between outputs and truth to obtain error
** Power(), Factorial(), Sin(), Cos(), Tan() are primitives that could make this evolution easier - idea of EMADE!

=== Lab 2 - Genetic Programming and Multi-Objective Optimization, Symbolic Regression: Results ===
'''Original Program'''
* Best individual is add(add(x, multiply(x, multiply(add(x, multiply(x, x)), x))), multiply(x, x))
* Best Fitness Score: 1.1712944886774969e-16
[[files/Lab2graph1.png|none|thumb]]
'''With Node Replacement Mutation Only'''
* Best individual is add(add(multiply(x, multiply(x, x)), x), multiply(x, add(subtract(add(x, x), subtract(add(x, x), x)), multiply(x, multiply(x, x)))))
* Best Fitness Score: 1.1187226938793687e-16
[[files/Lab2graph2.png|none|thumb]]
'''With New Primitives and Node Replacement Mutation'''
* Best individual is add(add(x, multiply(add(multiply(x, x), x), multiply(x, x))), square(x))
* Best Fitness Score: 1.2012964454916326e-16

=== Lecture 1: Genetic Algorithms ===
* '''Concept'''
** Each new generation is created through mating/mutation of individuals in the previous population with each individual's fitness being evaluated.
** Eventually produces the best individual/group of individuals whose fitness is better than everyone else's
** Process is Evolution
** Flow Chart: Initialize Population -> Evaluation -> Selection -> Crossover -> Mutation -> Evaluation (again) -> Complete
* '''Vocab'''
** Individual: one specific candidate in the population
** Population: group of individuals whose properties will be altered
** Objective: a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize/minimize
** Fitness: relative comparison to other individuals; how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to the rest of the population?
** Evaluation: a function that computes the objective of an individual
** Selection: represents 'survival of the fittest' - idea behind Evolution
*** Fitness Proportionate: the greater the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected for mating
*** Tournament: several tournaments among individuals; winners are selected for mating
** Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
** Mutate: introduces random changes; purpose is to maintain diversity
* '''Genetic Algorithm Steps'''
** Randomly initialize population
** Determine fitness of population
** Repeat:
*** Select parents from population
*** Perform crossover on parents creating population
*** Perform mutation of population
*** Determine fitness of population
* '''One-Max Problem'''
** Problem begins with individuals that each have a list of 100 values that are either 0s or 1s
** The end goal is to produce an individual list that contains all 1s

=== Lab 1 - Genetic Algorithms with DEAP: Results ===
'''One Max Problem'''
* Imported Necessary Modules (random and base, creator, tools from deap)
* Defined fitness objective and individual classes, evaluation function, genetic operators
* Ran evaluate, mate, select, and crossover/mutation functions
* Ran algorithm for 40 generations
* Consistently achieved max between 99.0 and 100.0
** was always at or very close to optimal max of 100.0
'''N Queens Problem'''
* Defined Evaluation, Crossover, Mutation functions
* Ran Main Evolutionary Loop for 100 generations
* Overall fitness decreased as the # of generations increased
** Successful result of a minimization problem
* Min value always was at or near optimal value of 0.0
