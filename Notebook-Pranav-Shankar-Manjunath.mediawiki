'''Team Notes:'''
* Our main goal at this point is to develop a general outline for the paper
** We had concerns about the direction of the paper but Dr. Zutty reiterated to us that the paper can mostly be completed without even having publishable results or even a specific topic.
** Our goal is to complete an outline by the end of the week to discuss at the next meeting
* Researching PACE-ICE vs. Colab...Colab currently is not sustainable for longer runs of EMADE

'''Team Notes:'''
* Part of the time conflict group within the Stocks subteam
** Planning to work with fellow time conflict members to develop and publish a paper by the end of the semester
*** Discussed the idea of merging with Modularity time conflict group but we ended up deciding to work separately
* Created a pull request to the main EMADE repository that contains the major changes - added features - that were implemented last Fall and Spring
** Have not yet merged...need to finalize the changes
* Paper details:
** Focus on more specific changes and runs to produce individuals that beat the paper
** Building a validation dataset to test the models created on new data (same stocks, or a completely different stock)
** Look further into the primitive comparison heat map we created last semester
** Build outline for the paper (Dr. Zutty says 80% of the paper can be written/outlined without publishable results)
* Time-Conflict Stocks Team Members:
** Abhiram Tirumala (Co-lead)
** Rishi Bhatnagar (Co-lead)
** Pranav Manjunath (Contributing Member)

=== Subteam Notes: ===
* Ran EMADE one more time
* <b>I spent most of the past week researching Technical Indicators</b>
** TA-Lib Indicators
*** STOCH_RSI - measure of RSI relative to itself (high-low range over a time period)
*** AROON - identifies whether a price is trending or within a trading range
**** AROONUP - measures length of time since last price high
**** AROONDOWN - measures length of time since last price low
*** ADX - used to determine the strength of a particular trend, makes use of +, - DIs
*** OBV - indicates degree of momentum, measures buying/selling pressure cumulatively and adds volume on up days and subtracts volume on down days. The actual value of OBV is irrelevant but it is important to pay attention to its direction and trend.
**** <b>Implemented OBV with Abhiram and Rishi's assistance</b>
** Non TA-Lib Indicators
*** VWMA (Volume Weighted Moving Average) - prices weighted based on “volume” of trading activity during a particular time period
**** 3-Day VWMA is calculated by multiplying each day’s volume by that same day’s closing price, adding all three combined values together and dividing by the total volume across the three days. (C1*V1 + C2*V2 + C3*V3) / (V1 + V2 + V3)
*** VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) - average price weighted by volume
**** Compute typical price ((H + L + C)/ 3), multiply by period’s volume, create a running total of these values and of volume
**** Calculated by dividing the running total of price-volume by the running total of volume
*** Fibonacci Retracement - used to set price targets, for technical analysis of stocks
**** 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, 78.6% (50% and 100% are also used although not technically Fibonacci ratios)

=== Subteam Notes: ===
* <b>I will do another EMADE run on Thursday. Most of the first-semester students' work has consisted of learning about TIs and running EMADE.</b>
* Trying to analyze new stocks but would have to get rid of old, or can use old with more features
* Need to optimize model to work with all stocks and not have to reset
* Need to implement more technical indicators with less time lag
* Double/triple data range from one year

<b>Thursday</b>
* Ichimoku Kink vs. Fibonacci Retracement
** Ichimoku Kink - Improves accuracy of forecasted price changes by building on candlestick charting
** Fibonacci Retracement - Form of technical analysis that determines support/resistance levels, Markets will retrace a predictable time range
*** Half the team will try out this method
** <b>Abhiram assigned me to work with Dhruv on a Visualization tool</b>

=== Subteam Notes: ===
* <b>With regard to the paper, I asked the team to explain Exponential Smoothing to me in a more detailed manner
** Went into detail about time-series data, forecasting, and prediction intervals</b>
<b>Statistics</b>
* Data is collected on several metrics
* A/B testing is an option
* Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation are important values
* Hypothesis testing: Mean + SD
* T-tests + p-values
** t-table, n-1 degrees of freedom
** p <= 0.05 --> observations are good
** Welch's T-test/Unequal Variance T-test
*** Test the hypothesis that two populations have equal means
*** Probability that both samples came from the same area
*** Utilized in finding out whether our changes resulted in any difference in our EMADE runs
** Ultimately, the greater the T-statistic, the less likely the given sample is observed with our hypothesis
* Apply tests to our sttocks
* Percentage --> random variable
* Problem: Lack of a normal distribution with our current 5 stocks
* Run EMADE again before Thursday's meeting
* In Thursday's meeting, I was placed in the Data Analysis Division
** Our other two teams are Literature Review + Research and Implementation in EMADE

** Train, test, target data
* EmadeData class
** Train and test data are EmadeData
** Stream Data (useful for time-series + image reps)
** Feature Data - input to ML
* Stocks code
** Stream data - raw price, volume, etc.
** Each line represents past 20 days window with 6 consecutive data repeat
** Functions - written to calculate TIs (Technical Indicators)
*** Primitive Functions (Ex: mySMA) - run for every line in dataset, creating a new feature
**** Can be stacked on each other and computed with features to train with a regression model

=== Team Meeting/Lecture Notes: ===
* Discussed Titanic Skaggle Assignment
* Titanic Genetic Programming Assignment was introduced
** We were told not to use algorithms listed directly in the algorithm module in the DEAP library
** We were told not to use a tournament-selection algorithm

=== Subteam 4 Notes: ===
* Discussed what primitives, mutation functions, mating functions, and selection functions we would use
* <b>I discovered that square was the most helpful primitive in improving our accuracy and reducing AUC (I figured this out from Lab 2).
* I tried a couple of different Mutation Functions before settling on mutUniform
** Experimentation primarily relied on DEAP library-based reasoning along with experimenting with random mutation functions and mutation functions from previous labs that worked.
** I tried mutShrink because it's a function that's used mostly with large trees. Accuracy and AUC did not improve.
** I also attempted to use mutNodeReplacement. Accuracy improved marginally but AUC increased. This was a function that was used in a previous lab and I thought it might work.
** I tried to use mutEphemeral. I saw marginal improvement but decided against using it because it did not utilize our expr function and I wasn't sure that modifying the constants of the tree individual was the right way to go.
** Ultimately I ended up using mutUniform. I thought it was a good choice because not only did both Accuracy and AUC improve but I was able to utilize our expr function properly.</b>

* Utilized selBest and SPEA2 as our selection functions (we weren't allowed to use tournament selection)
* Ultimately we were able to lower our AUC and improve our accuracy a considerable amount

* Assignment was to clean [https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic Titanic Challenge] Project data and then run ML algorithms on it
** Each Team Member was supposed to come up with an ML algorithm that is co-dominant to other team members' chosen ML algorithms

=== Subteam 4 Notes: ===
* Team Lead is [https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/Notebook_Rishit_Mohan_Ahuja Rishit Ahuja]
* Found that Cabin Column had several null values (over 3/4 ~ 77%) so we removed it from our data
* Encoded categorical features
** For name, we used the name titles and the length of the name
** PClass had a -33% correlation with the survival rate. We label encoded it.
** Embarked was One Hot Encoded but eventually dropped
* Ticket Identifier
** Didn't correlate very well with Survival
** Used to generate features for ticket length similar to with name
** Used to generate feature that contained first ticket letter
* Swapped out NULL values with the feature's average value (calculated excluding the NULL values)
* Generated Confusion Matrix and calculated Accuracy for all 6 chosen algorithms
* <b>Personally Chosen Algorithm: Support Vector Machine
** Utilized Linear Kernel
** Achieved 0.8305084745762712 Accuracy</b>

=== Lecture 3: Multiple Objectives - The MO in MOGA and MOGP ===
* '''Genes'''
** Gene pool - the set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation
*** Genome - genotypic description of an individual's DNA
**** GA - set of values, GP - tree structure, string
*** Search Space
**** set of all possible genome, set of all possible algorithms
**** size is important
** Evaluation of a Genome - associates a genome with a set of scores
*** TP - True Positive
*** FP - False Positive
*** Objectives - set of measurements each genome is scored against - phenotype
**** Objective Space - set of objectives
*** Evaluation - Maps a genome/individual
**** Genotypic description - from a location in search space
**** Phenotypic description - to a location in objective space
*** Sensitivity - True Positive Rate
*** Specificity - True Negative Rate
* '''Objective Space'''
** Each individual is evaluated using objective functions
*** Mean Squared Error
*** Cost
*** Complexity
*** True Positive Rate
*** False Positive Rate
*** Etc.
** Objective scores give each individual a point in objective space
** May be referred to as the phenotype
* '''Pareto Optimality'''
** An individual is Pareto optimal if there's no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives
** Set of all Pareto individuals is known as the Pareto frontier
** These individuals represent unique contributions
** Pareto individuals should be favored in order to drive Natural Selection
*** But, maintain diversity by giving all individuals some probability of mating
* '''Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II)'''
** Population is separated into nondomination ranks
** Individuals are selected using a binary tournament
** Lower Pareto > Higher Pareto
** Ties are broken by crowding distance
*** Crowding Distance - summation of normalized Euclidean distances to all points within the front
*** Higher Crowding Distance > Lower Crowding Distance
* '''Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2)'''
** Each individual is given a strength S - how many others in the population it dominates
** Each individual is given a rank R - the sum of S's of the individuals that dominate it
*** Pareto individuals are nondominated and receive an R of 0
** A distance to kth nearest neighbor is calculated (σk) and fitness of R + 1/(σk + 2) is obtained

=== Lab 2 - Genetic Programming and Multi-Objective Optimization, Multi-Objective Genetic Programming with Symbolic Regression: Results ===
* Goal was to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the size of our tree
'''Original Results'''
* Utilized exiting registered functions and didn't change any parameters
* Best individual is: negative(cos(multiply(add(cos(sin(cos(sin(cos(tan(x)))))), cos(x)), tan(x)))) with fitness: (0.2786133308027132, 15.0)
* AUC of Pareto Front Graph was 2.3841416372199005
[[files/Lab2originalobjectivespacegraph.png|none|thumb]]
[[files/Lab2part2graph1original.png|none|thumb]]
[[files/Lab2graph2original.png|none|thumb]]
'''Results after modifying mutation and select functions:'''
* Goal was to improve algorithm by reducing AUC by 25% or more -> AUC should be <= 1.788106228
* Changed mutation function from mutUniform to mutEphemeral with parameter mode = "all"
* Changed select function parameter tournsize from 3 to 4
* AUC of Pareto Front Graph was 1.0026141205075572, meaning the AUC was decreased by approximately 58%
* Best individual is: subtract(sin(x), add(x, cos(x))) with fitness: (0.4909135054438985, 7.0)

== Jan 27th, 2021 - Feb 2nd, 2021 ==

=== Lecture 2: Genetic Programming ===
* '''Concept'''
** Instead of taking an individual and having a function evaluator to contain objective scores, the individual is the function itself
* '''Tree Representation'''
** Program can be represented as a Tree structure
*** Nodes - primitive, represent functions
*** Leaves - terminals, represent parameters
**** Input = type of terminal
**** Output -> produced at the root of the tree
** How is the Tree Stored?
*** Converted to a lisp <u>preordered</u> parse tree - Operator followed by inputs
** Example 1
*** The tree for f(X) = 3 * 4 + 1 can be written as [+, *, 3, 4, 1]
**** Parse is written in pre-order but read in-order -> (3 *4) + 1
*** This comes from using the root first and then expanding
**** [+, input1, input2]
**** [+, *, input3, input4, 1]
**** [+, *, 3, 4, 1] [[files/Smalltree1.png|none|thumb]]
** Example 2
*** The tree for f(X) = 2 - (0 + 1) can be written as [-, 2, +, 0, 1] [[files/Smalltree2.png|none|thumb]]
* '''Crossover in GP'''
** Exchanging Subtrees
** Start by randomly picking a point in each tree
** These points and everything below them create subtrees
* '''Mutation in GP'''
** Insert, deleting, or changing a node/subtree
** Example: Symbolic Regression
** Primitives include: +, *, -, /
** Terminals include integers and: X
** Solution: Taylor series for sin(x)
** Third-order Expression: [-. x, /, *, x, *, x, x, *, 3, 2]
* '''Evaluating a Tree'''
** Feed inputs into function and calculate difference between outputs and truth to obtain error
** Power(), Factorial(), Sin(), Cos(), Tan() are primitives that could make this evolution easier - idea of EMADE!

=== Lab 2 - Genetic Programming and Multi-Objective Optimization, Symbolic Regression: Results ===
'''Original Program'''
* Best individual is add(add(x, multiply(x, multiply(add(x, multiply(x, x)), x))), multiply(x, x))
* Best Fitness Score: 1.1712944886774969e-16
[[files/Lab2graph1.png|none|thumb]]
'''With Node Replacement Mutation Only'''
* Best individual is add(add(multiply(x, multiply(x, x)), x), multiply(x, add(subtract(add(x, x), subtract(add(x, x), x)), multiply(x, multiply(x, x)))))
* Best Fitness Score: 1.1187226938793687e-16

=== Lecture 1: Genetic Algorithms ===
* '''Concept'''
** Each new generation is created through mating/mutation of individuals in the previous population with each individual's fitness being evaluated.
** Eventually produces the best individual/group of individuals whose fitness is better than everyone else's
** Process is Evolution
** Flow Chart: Initialize Population -> Evaluation -> Selection -> Crossover -> Mutation -> Evaluation (again) -> Complete
* '''Vocab'''
** Individual: one specific candidate in the population
** Population: group of individuals whose properties will be altered
** Objective: a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize/minimize
** Fitness: relative comparison to other individuals; how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to the rest of the population?
** Evaluation: a function that computes the objective of an individual
** Selection: represents 'survival of the fittest' - idea behind Evolution
*** Fitness Proportionate: the greater the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected for mating
*** Tournament: several tournaments among individuals; winners are selected for mating
** Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
** Mutate: introduces random changes; purpose is to maintain diversity
* '''Genetic Algorithm Steps'''
** Randomly initialize population
** Determine fitness of population
** Repeat:
*** Select parents from population
*** Perform crossover on parents creating population
*** Perform mutation of population
*** Determine fitness of population
* '''One-Max Problem'''
** Problem begins with individuals that each have a list of 100 values that are either 0s or 1s
** The end goal is to produce an individual list that contains all 1s

=== Lab 1 - Genetic Algorithms with DEAP: Results ===
'''One Max Problem'''
* Imported Necessary Modules (random and base, creator, tools from deap)
* Defined fitness objective and individual classes, evaluation function, genetic operators
* Ran evaluate, mate, select, and crossover/mutation functions
* Ran algorithm for 40 generations
* Consistently achieved max between 99.0 and 100.0
** was always at or very close to optimal max of 100.0
'''N Queens Problem'''
* Defined Evaluation, Crossover, Mutation functions
* Ran Main Evolutionary Loop for 100 generations
* Overall fitness decreased as the # of generations increased
** Successful result of a minimization problem
* Min value always was at or near optimal value of 0.0
