== April 30, 2021 ==

=== Subteam Meeting Notes ===
* A lot of the team members in the mnist team were having trouble doing runs as masters
* My runs disconnected because a connectivity issue, my apartments wifi resets every few hours which interrupts the run
* Still was able to run as worker on google colab
* Over the week I helped Krithik figure out why his run would not work, we think it might have been outdated files on colab

== April 25, 2021 ==

=== Subteam Meeting Notes ===
* Bernadette had to opt out of the task for health issues 
* Krithik and I had trouble figuring out how to go about compressing the nodes, but made some updates to adf.py to set up a little more syntax in adfs.py
* Gabriel told the Tree Database Structure team to prioritize doing MNIST runs instead
* We will be joining the returning members to do some mnist runs
* Vincent seems to be able to run as master so we will be joining as workers
* The new members are going to be working on the other dataset
* Kevin and Gabriel are going to be fixing some bugs on the main files

=== Subteam Meeting Notes ===
* Gabriel assigned Bernadette and Krithik to help me continue the update on the database structure
* Gabriel gave us a runover the concepts to help Bernadette and Krithik understand what we are working on
* As a brief explanation for anyone new to this here is a brief runover:
** For the tree database structure, instead of relying on lambda functionsfor our ARLs as we did previously, we now want to treat them like individuals with their complete tree structure so we don't lose certain information in the process. To accomplish this, we need to compress and expand individuals with ARLs in a different way. Currently, we find desired combinations, then convert them to a single function in the form of a lambda, but With this new architecture we aim to find node combinations, store the nodes in the database in their tree form, and condense the ARL into a single node. Then when referenced, the node expands into its tree form from the database. 
* I introduced Bernadette and Krithik to the branch and updates I have been working on
** adfs.py
** EMADE.py

== February 28, 2021 ==

=== Subteam Meeting Notes ===
* Vincent, Bernadette, Xufei and Kevin will continue to work on the depth problem and how we're finding ARLs. Accordingly, Kevin wrote the following tasks
** Write method search_individual(individual, dictionary, length): This method is just traversing through a single individual in the population
** Write method add_all_subtrees(individual, node, dictionary, length): This method is for when you get to a node, add all subtrees of depth between 1 and length, inclusive to the dictionary as possible ARLs
** The generate_adf method will need to be changed to use the value calculated with add_all_subtrees to be how we select ARLs
* Me, Gabriel, and Angela will be focusing on database structure and how to store ARLs. We split into two main tasks
** Alter code for Genetic Duplicates / New Individuals after each generation
*** https://github.gatech.edu/gwang340/emade/tree/genetic_duplicate
** Alter code for tree storage in the database
*** https://github.gatech.edu/gwang340/emade/tree/tree_database
* Angela will be working on Genetic Duplicates while I will be working on updating the database
* For the database, I will update it based on the new subtree depth, in order to do that I will update the following methods
** EMADE.py - master_algorithm()
** adfs.py - contract_adfs()
** sql_connection_orm_master.py - adfs()

=== Subteam Meeting Notes ===
* We went individually over our papers giving a brief overview of their content
* The paper I chose was [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36599-0_23 Modularity in Genetic Programming by John R. Woodward]
** The paper does a great job at conceptually explaining how these concepts tie together, it starts off by explaining how Genetic Programming uses a tree based representation to express solutions to problems. It goes on to explain how the trees are constructed from a primitive set which consists of a function set and a terminal set. It elaborates on the genetic programming's ability to define modules, which are tree-based representations defined in terms of the primitives. It also dives into Automatically Defined Functions (ADFs) which is what we focus on in this subteam. It also follows on to prove that for a given problem, the minimum number of nodes in the main tree plus the nodes in any modules is independent of the primitive set and depends only on the function being expressed. Overall, it helped me solidify my knowledge on the current concepts as well as dive into more specific conceptual gaps I had not realized I held, it also helped me understand how user-defined parameters in the run may be dependent or independent of the primitive set.

=== Individual Notes ===
*I will be presenting the Alternate Selection Method experiment, this experiment directly increases the probability of getting ARLs by scaling each individual’s probability of getting selected for tournament linearly with the number of ARLs they have.
*Presentation talking points and notes:
*[[files/Alternate Selection AUC Graphs.png|left|thumb|AUCs of the new runs]]
** When talking about graphs, mention its meaning.
** Graph is comparing the average AUCs of the new runs with the average of the benchmark.
** We were able to do 9 runs of this experiment which is represented by our blue lines,  it is being compared to the baseline in red that also has a sample size of 9.
** AUCs of these runs perform okay in earlier generations, but stop performing as well and converge towards the later generations, observable in left graph  around generation 25 and again at around generation 35
** On the left graph, the blue line which is the experiment’s P-Value of Difference in the Mean AUC,  when compared to the red line which is the benchmark P-Value, throughout all the runs, there was a statistical significance in generations eleven through nineteen as we see the values go under the red threshold, which means that the changes we made are positive.
**[[files/ARL Runs.png|left|thumb|ARLs in the new runs]]The target is for the selection method to increase the number of ARLs.
** In the graph at the top, the red line represents the benchmark, and the blue line represents  the selection method.
** The benchmark we used was different, it was on ARL runs, not runs without ARLs, because we want to see how the number of them compare with each other in the runs.
** On the bottom graph we can see that the blue line never goes under the p-value, the red threshold, which means that there are no statistically significant changes in the amount of ARLs.
** Takeaways that we got from this experiment were that there was a statistical significance in  generations 11 to 19, but might be because its benefitting from initial standard deviation
** The values converged with the baseline at later generations.
** Overall, there was not a significant change to the number of ARLs per individuals
** There were major bloat issues with some individuals that had up to 40 or more ARLs
** It is also to note that significance may arise from the argument fix, and not the selection method itself

* We will have a dry run of presentation with Dr. Zutty and Greg

* Midterm Presentation Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZTS5ij1kNA8cymFyIYWU1fkuJe3PuNVl_H2IyzB22RQ/edit?usp=sharing

=== Individual Notes ===
*Started making runs with Ruarai on Data Pair, but we were only able to finish 2 runs due to long run times
*Seems the runs have long run times since I also tried running on my end with similar run times

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* Ruarai and Kevin discussed the possibility of adding a small change to Data Pair before midterm presentations
* Gabe reported a minor issue in the differential fitness branch
* We started discussing the presentation, Aryender is starting it and sending it to us to complete
* Gabe discussed the possibility of running EMADE on Icehammer, but since everyone 

=== Individual Notes ===
*Google Colabs has been set up, connected to server correctly, was able to do a trial run
*Locally ran src/GPFramework/launchEMADE.py templates/input_titanic_DiffFitness.xml in the branch DifferentialFitness_NoRefactor
**Kept getting "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'sum' referenced before assignment" after around 7-13 Generations
**After pulling and restarting computer, error went away
**Was able to run up until 46 Generations before my computer crashed, but received no errors from EMADE
**Seems Gabes error was local and not global

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* Discussed the ARG issue, figuring out how to fix it is the main priority right now, we may not be able to get significant results until its fixed
* We will not be doing runs for the meantime until ARG is fixed
* Once fixed, we will be rerunning experiments
* Kevin reported to be having a seeding issue I also encountered in the past but forgot to ask about

=== Individual Notes ===
*Google Colabs has been set up, just need to make sure server is correctly connected
*Locally ran src/GPFramework/launchEMADE.py templates/input_titanic_DiffFitness.xml in the branch DifferentialFitness_NoRefactor
**Kept getting "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'sum' referenced before assignment" after around 7-13 Generations
**Gabriel told me it was from a previous bug that was already corrected, I just had to pull
**I pulled and reinstalled but kept getting error, however it disappeared once I restarted my computer
**I do not seem to be having the same issue as Gabriel as I have successfully ran 20 Gens, but will try to run 49 just to make sure

== April 19, 2020 ==

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* We had a dry run of our presentation 
* Got feedback to add the reason behind each expectation 
* Update slide content:
** Fewer types of ADFs that are higher quality
*** We previously constrained the individuals contributing ADFs to valid individuals, but now we constrain it to individuals with positive differential fitness which results in a smaller pool of ADF candidates
** ADFs less common in the population
*** Individuals improving over their parents are more likely to find novel subtrees
*** Novel ADFs would be inserted into less individuals when found
** Higher percentage of ADFs on the pareto front than off
*** All pareto-front individuals have positive differential fitness, so they are more likely to make up more of the ADF candidates

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* The second part of the Titanic Machine Learning challenge was assigned, now focusing in Titanic MOGP (Multi-Objective Genetic Programming ) Classifier

=== Individual Notes ===
*Objective: Submit a CSV file containing the predictions on test.csv for each Pareto optimal individual in train.csv
*Goals:
** Create new Pareto Front
** Create an evolutionary loop
** Create a classifier to evaluate and minimize FP and FN
** Evolve a classifier
** Built-in Deap algorithms are not allowed
'''Multi-Objective Genetic Programming Lab:'''
* Primitives: We normalized all of the data so we could work with arithmetic operations that would make the process simpler
** Our tree produced a value between 0 to 1 which we later rounded to represent the survival state of each passenger
** Primitives employed: We used logical operators and if-then statements
* Evaluation function: It took the output of each individual and compared it by subtracting the predicted results it held from the real results
** 1.0 = False Positive
** -1.0 = False Negative
** 0.0 = Correct prediction

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* We went over The Multiple Objectives in MOGA and MOGP

=== Individual Notes ===
* Instead of working with a single objective to maximize or minimize it, we can work with multiple objectives
* Classification of Algorithm concepts:
** GA: Set of values
** GP: Tree structure
** True positive: Correct evaluation
** False positive: False evaluation
** Sensitivity rate: The rate at which the classifier predicts true values
*** True Positive Rate: Rate of true positives being predicted
*** True Negative Rate: Rate of true negatives being predicted
** Objective Spaces: Each individual is evaluated by the use of objective functions
*** Mean Squared Error, Cost, Complexity, TPR, FPR
*** Represented by multiple axes in the specified object space
** Pareto Optimality: When there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives
*** Set of Pareto individuals in known as Pareto Frontier
** Area under curve: The smaller the area under the curve, the more optimized the algorithm is
** Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NDGA II): When the population is separated into non-dominated ranks
** Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA II): When individuals are given a strength, which represents the number of individuals in a "dominating box"

* We went over the principles of Genetic Programming

=== Individual Notes ===
* Genetics programming structured as a tree
* Genomes: Lists that are a potential solution to a problem
** Nodes: Primitives (functions)
** Leaves: Terminals (inputs/parameters)
* Input: Like a particular type of terminal
* Output: Produced at the root of the tree
* Mutation in genetic algorithm can involve:
** Inserting a node/subtree
** Deleting a node
** Changing a node

* Cross over can involve:
** swapping at two random points

* We went over how to make a VIP Notebook using the Wiki editor
* We went over the basic principles of Genetic Algorithms

=== Individual Notes ===
* Genetic Algorithms: Refers to an evolutionary technique. It is when each new generation that is created though a process of mutation of individuals based in the previous population
* Reproduction: 
** Mutation: Random modifications
** Crossover: Mating of individuals
* Fitness: comparison/differences between individuals
* Population: the group of individuals that are being altered
