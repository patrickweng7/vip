===Meeting Notes:===
Presentations will done next Wednesday. Pretty slow week due to travel and Thanksgiving but work on presentation or runs if any are remaining for your experiment.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
Divvied up parts of the presentation so each member would have the chance to present some of the work we did over the course of the semester. Continue working on presentation so that we can do a practice run.

== November 16, 2020 ==

===Meeting Notes:===
MNIST is coming along well. Will likely be able to have some runs before our final presentation if things continue to progress. Resources were found through Gabe's connection to GTRI that have proved instrumental in aiding Jacob.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
Continuing to do runs. Things are looking good to get enough runs to do some rudimentary analysis for our final presentation. There are a good number of DataPair restricted runs to analysis on.

=== Individual Work: ===
Used the script created last week to do some analysis. In most cases there were only a couple adfs that achieved high penetration into the population which in most of the runs consisted of ModifyLearners or adfs created very early in the process from the seeded individuals. This potentially could be because individuals created with ARLs of Learners, Filters, etc. had too much impact on the individual and lead to very high crowding between all individuals of the type. Another theory might be that the pool of potential ARL candidates is so small at early generations that the heuristics attempting to select good subsections of code are left picking whatever is valid since we create a fixed number per generation rather than waiting until good learners and the like are found naturally through evolution and then attempting to spread them. This leaves the less impactful of the adfs more prone to spread because if they aren't great yet the individuals containing them can still evolve fully to become better.

== November 9, 2020 ==

===Meeting Notes:===
Kevin presented notes about his runs. There is some statistical significance at the usual areas but the number of adfs didn't drastically increase. Additionally, the average number of adfs was found to be largely due to "supercarriers" which could contain up to 70 or so bloat adfs and likely had been created through some perverse incentives during evolution. He will likely merge in my changes to see if with the restriction the selection method performs better.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
Runs are going slowly so Gabe set up 7 collabs to be used as workers and a google drive to help set up checkouts so multiple people don't try and run using the same account at the same time. Potentially the first semesters will be largely in charge of ensuring these accounts are running so they can get more experience dealing with Emade and some of the issues that can arise.

=== Individual Work: ===
Worked on a script to help analyze which adfs were actually being used since I noticed that at later generations of some of the runs the same adf would appear a great deal but the vast majority of adfs would not. I was curious if the trend continued and if there was anything that could be extracted from the adfs that successfully spread in the population compared to those which died out. I committed the changes to the repo of adf related scripts I created last semester. This commit mostly adds a method that creates a dictionary to keep track of how many of each adf is found in the population as a whole.

===Meeting Notes:===
Kevin did some analysis on the Selection branch. Some of us are having success with runs some are having less success. Regina and I are working together to try and get some complete runs.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
Jacob has continued making progress on MNIST dataset. The rest of us have been doing runs, lots unsuccessful though. First semesters are largely up to speed on what ARLs are. They have also been shown the current Collab set up and can start helping with runs.

=== Individual Work: ===
Looked into whether the DataPair change was creating far more valid individuals with learners and that was responsible for the increased computation time compared to previous experiments. I used the mysql command below to find the number of valid individuals for generations where evaluation was complete and did some very basic statistical analysis on the number given for benchmark runs vs the new restricted ARL runs at generations 20 and 25 and didn't find anything. The variance was large and the average was extremely close so the p-value ended up at .4. Perhaps it is due to the change causing the spread of the learners used in the seeded individuals which might just take more time than some other learners but since the equipment used for the benchmark was so different than the current collab setup and at times multiple different types of workers were being used it didn't seem worthwhile to investigate further since the primary suspect had been eliminated and there wouldn't be many things that could be done if any of the other theories were correct.<blockquote>SELECT evaluation_gen, SUM(ISNULL(error_string)) FROM adf_benchmark_2.individuals GROUP BY evaluation_gen;</blockquote>

=== Individual Work: ===
Merged in Gabe's ARL fixes to my branch and started trying to do some runs. It is progressing very slowly on Collab and timed out well before it reached even 40 gens. Need to make sure there isn't something wrong with the template file but from looking at Kevin's template file it doesn't appear anything is awry. Perhaps adding workers through additional collabs will be needed to ensure results that are remotely useful. Might also look into why it is taking so much longer.

The part on the Data Pair Restriction experiment is what I worked on.
== October 5, 2020 ==

===Meeting Notes:===
Notebooks are due tonight.

Presentation in 2 weeks.

Issue with inability to create adfs that impact Arg0 is vital and should be put as high priority.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
Looking into the Arg0 fix with Gabe. We have different approaches and it looks like his approach to fix the issue with the lambda is the better solution since it more cleanly solves the issue without making a lot of other changes. Progress is being made on MNIST by Jacob but there seems to be tons of issues to work through so it might take some time.

=== Individual Work: ===
Looked into the codebase to try and fix the Arg0 issue. Over the course of investigating I realized that if we allowed partial adfs, adfs that contained a parent and some nonnegative amount of it's children rather than the full height 2 tree the parent is the root of, the problem would be largely fixed since Arg0 could remain as an unmodified child to the new adf. Started looking into making this change a reality but the infrastructure change it would require is vast since the adf creation process currently has the size and shape hardcoded into a bunch of different methods. Additionally, it would break all of the new heuristics so likely wouldn't be feasible and would stray far away from the original intended experiment with the data pair restriction.

== September 28, 2020 ==

===Meeting Notes:===
Discussed DataPair Issue with Gabe. It appears to be a quite important issue since it has caused numerous adfs over the course of the generations that might have been good to not be created. The section of the code it is from is quite old so I'll potentially take a look but for now it will be treated as a blocking issue.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
Quick meeting.

Discussed an auto clicker to prevent timing out on collab. All appears set up to begin doing tests on the platform. Isn't as convenient but should still work.

== September 21, 2020 ==

===Meeting Notes:===
We should try to get additional data sets running so we can test adfs on them.

=== Individual Work: ===

Continued looking into the DataPair change and trying to debug the issue. Spent a deal of time testing things with my changes but ended up figuring out the issue is caused in the adf_info_to_lambda method since it requires that ADFs do not contain any arg_N. Since almost all nodes that directly return a data pair also take in the data pair this prevents the creating of learner adfs until much further into the generations when there is sufficient intermediary nodes. I'm kind of stuck on how to fix this since this part of the code is from before my time so we'll probably wait to test this branch until Gabe manages to fix the issue. I pushed the changes to a branch anyway so once we get it solved we can test out how the change effects everything.

===Meeting Notes:===
Finish self eval for next week.

Experiencing some issues with both collab and pace but hopefully we'll get it working soon.

Results of selection method are in and with more runs there was no statistical significance. It appears that it has helped but nothing significant. Hopefully this semester we finally get past that barrier.

just added a check to the return type.

Having a lot of bugs that I don't think are associated with the change I made though. Will be looking through the branches to see if perhaps I'm running a buggy branch but currently even after removing my change no ADFs are being created even when they are logging as having impacting the data pair.

Very little work was done since last meeting due to Labor Day and still working on ideas.

Losing google cloud credits soon so need to work on getting collab and pace working.

Half of the team is working on pace half on collab. I'm working on pace.

https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3377929.3389852

I read the above presentation on ideas on how to create better trees that attempts to incorporate novelty in order to increase genetic diversity. I think it might work for adfs as well but as it currently stands it would require a lot of work and might end up counteracting other progress we are trying to make. It seems that once we get adfs only to manipulate the Emade data pair perhaps we could try and create variables to capture its demonstrated behavior but until that point I think we might instead just lead to novelty through increasingly useless nodes that do little to effect the tree as a whole. It does seem like if the work was put in to test this project though, it would be better done on the entire tree and not as a piece of adfs. Perhaps in the future a group will work on it but for now I think the ideas don't present any actionable insights.

===Meeting Notes:===
ADF subteam will be meeting from 4-5pm on Fridays at http://bluejeans.com/638613382

Gabe is going to continue trying to get runs in so we can finalize the results we had last semester.

Everyone else still needs tasking but we discussed ideas 


===Team Meeting Notes:===
I was assigned to run the diff fitness on my machine, we will see how well it works since my laptop is underpowered and has historically struggled.

===Meeting Notes:===
Final Presentations!!!!

Research Fundementals:
* Bloat Metric
* average change in size of individuals in population vs average change in fitness
* Neat GP
** natural controls boat
** has significatnly changed selection method
* Speciation
** assigned greedily
** runs through most trees in the population to compare distance
* tests at .15 - close to 1, .3 - close to 1, .6 - around 8
** How many trees were assigned to each species at each speciation? Slide 9
* increased hypervolume - three d auc
* didn't help bloat metric
* Would having a higher number of individuals per run help since with the many different primitives perhaps to find similarities you just need more trees to compare?
* Have a Pace working with 8 runs at a time!!! 
** Could definitely be helpful to try and do similar for adf team.
Neural Networks:
* lots of lots of primitives created by the new semester students 
** many common activation functions and a few more complicated network functions
* had issues with multilable data set
** also was very sparse so much work was needed
* significant improvement of hand tunes accuracy
* practically no difference between old and new primitives
conflict team:
* text summarization vs classification of other nn group
* lots of sql issues and pace issues
* did some testing locally and on pace of the two primitives they have created
** excessively long times make it impossible to add primitives to trees and instead they need to be run on the data before it is passed in
ezCGP:
* inclusion of preproccesing block helped even though it was quite simple
* different implementations with better accuracy than anything seen so far
* New students created primitives
* went from pace to gcloud

== April 6, 2020 ==

===Meeting Notes:===
Opportunity for practice presentation attended by both professors.

Differential fitness and selection method changes are both done and on branches ready to test. Aaron will start runs for each so we will hopefully have a full number of runs for the presentation but it is more likely that we will be analyzing based on incomplete data. The primitive analysis team will also be analyzing the new runs using the scripts they produced and will compare it against the baseline runs. We will be doing a practice run at some point over the weekend hopefully.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
I have a script up and running which finds the average number of adfs per individual for each generation in a run. During the meeting discussed how we were going to break down our section of the presentation and distribute the word. Jacob will be doing an analysis on the auc with our selection method against the auc of runs without it. We do not expect significant changes since adfs as a whole didn't alter the end result much and increasing their frequency is unlikely to change anything. Kevin will be doing an analysis of the actual adf frequency which is the item we were hoping to increase. Hopefully he finds some statistically significant evidence of that but initial results do not seem to indicate such a finding. Since the two main metrics have already been assigned out, I gave Chido the task of analyzing the relationship between adf frequency and auc because I noticed as I was running my script there was significant variation even within samples and wondered if the random variation of adf frequency had any correlation to the random variations of auc.

Pushed it to a separate repo since it hasn't been cleaned up yet and is still finicky at times. Added code to find auc for each generation and potentially fixed the current code in viz that results in increasing AUCs at times. This code also makes it rather easy to quickly go through a lot of sql dumps to find the values in question whereas my previous branch of viz was much slower.

===Meeting Notes:===
Differential fitness has made great progress and is poised to be ready to test next week. Primitive analysis has made progress. There was some misunderstanding on my part with selection methods where I though selection had to do with how adfs were selected but instead the original idea was to make a new method for selecting which individuals from the population would mate. My team has pivoted well and each member will present a new selection method for individuals on Friday and we will compare methodologies and select the best pieces of each one for our final method we will add to weight adfs.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
Good progress all around. Jacob and I had similar approaches with editing the tournament to include adfs when determining the better individual. Kevin took a different approach and used the number of adfs in an individual to impact the way the weighting in weighted nsga2 worked which increased the odds of individuals with adfs being selected to enter the tournament. Chido was swamped with work this week so didn't manage to create his selection method yet but presented his ideas which aligned well with Jacob's method. We have decided to go with Jacob's since it had no unresolved bugs and placed a lower emphasis on ADF's than mine which the team felt would preserve the integrity of evolutionary process better for the original fitness metrics. I cleaned up the code afterwards and created branch with the new method which will hopefully be merged into master soon so testing can commence.

Commit with the new selection method. This commit uses the tournament that Jacob outlined with the only change from my original code being the order in which the three things are considered where I had the adf counts ahead of the crowding distance but now we have instead decided to weigh them equally.

===Meeting Notes:===
Finished the presentation for the first semesters. Released survey about sub-subteam interest and split the returning students among the groups by interest for them to help lead. Gabe and Aryender will be working on primitive analysis with first semesters, Aaron will be working on differential fitness with his team, and I will be working on a selection method with my team.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
Met with the new selection method sub-subteam for the first time!!! Current team members are Jacob, Chido, Kevin, and I. There were issues around the board connecting to bluejeans so used Webex instead which still had connection issues but was serviceable. 

Lead a presentation on how selection is done currently and the two philosophies employed during selection of adfs for the first semesters. Utilized Aryender's code for intelligent ADF's to show a framework for the work we will be doing. Assigned the first semesters to work through the snippet of code on their own time to ensure they have a good grasp on how the pieces are connected and search for other ideas for a selection method. Currently, I was thinking that incorporating size of the individual could yield better results since given two individuals of approximately equal fitness, on average the nodes in the smaller tree would be doing more useful work. Whether this manifests in each tree having a similar number of useful nodes with the larger tree just having more bloat or each node in the smaller tree being more useful, I'm not sure about, but regardless selecting adfs from the smaller tree will still on average yield better adfs hopefully. More ideas should be coming in the Monday meeting and perhaps research will be found to back up my proposal.

=== Individual Work: ===
Individual work this week was rather light since the beginning of the week mostly involved preparing talking points for the sub sub team meeting during which I was trying to teach the new members how ADFs are selected. Due to thinking that the code was the best place to explain this from I didn't create any slides however since I thought going to the source would alleviate more confusion. I also did some thinking about what we could implement as a different selection criteria though after communication with Gabe and Aaron later I realized I had defaulted to thinking about the wrong type of selection so scrapped the limited work I had done and prepared to create a new method to select individuals for mating.

== March 23, 2020 - Trial Week ==

===Meeting Notes:===
The class will continue on largely as was originally scheduled with everything just transitioned online. The first semesters have been distributed based on their preferences and as the ADF team we are welcoming Abhiram, Chido, Katie, Kevin, Reagan, Avni, Min, and Jacob. Very excited to have all these new team members!!!

===Team Meeting Notes:===
Made our way through roughly 2/3 of the new introduction to EMADE and adfs presentation for the first years. Mostly just working on getting everyone up to speed while everyone makes sure they have everything they need set up in order to complete their coursework for the rest of the semester. During the presentation we linked to a number of papers that would aid in giving an overview of the ideas on which our team was created.

===Meeting Notes:===
Midterm Presentations!!!

Titanic groups:
* First group had some issues with calculating auc which caused some excitement
* there were far more novel ideas and takes on the presentations than during my semester
* still very similar so my notes all blended together
Bloat:
* Ran very limited tests
* Are working on idea of speciation
* have weird issue with sudden drop in individual number
** unsure if it is in base Emade or with their change
NLP:
* Have created a few primitives
* Significant issues trying to run on PACE
** still don't have many tests due to these issues
Time Conflict:
* Have begun work on a few primitives
** have written unit tests to ensure the primitives work
** have not implemented the primitives into Emade yet
* significant issues trying to run on PACE
EZCGP:
* Massive overhaul moving to tensorflow 2.0
** seems like it has largely invalidated most of their previous work
** would be curious if they are able to abstract away from it with their new code to allow for easier future accomidation
* issues running on Pace
* compared performance with different numbers of processors for their code
** it seems due to issues with transferring data between each core it doesn't help in the way it would be expected

=== Individual Work: ===
With spring break and massive amount of turmoil caused by Coronavirus, I did not manage any individual work this week beyond a cursory look into the difficulty of implementing a different mutation who's purpose would be adding an adf rather than just adding arbitrary node. This idea was presented to us by Jason in the run up to the midterm presentation and seemed like it might hold promise. The creation of the method seems rather simple so depending on what our plans are post regroup with the new members I might try and implement it.

== March 2, 2020 ==

Went over tips regarding good presentations. Page numbers, context for graphs, and results are all good to include.

We did some general planning for our presentation and split up sections for each of us to talk about.

Hackathon this week! I won't be able to attend due to athletic event at Clemson. Results are in for p value of final auc as well as average auc, no significance p = .67. Thinking through different metrics such as auc cutoff, auc slope, etc. in order to try and find if there was any significant change to auc values what so ever. After having talked to Jason though we might find more success looking at other ways adf could help enable such as keeping size down and helping explainability.

Added screenshot of my script since it is a part of Gabe's commit adding a Jupiter notebook to notebook part of our repo. When utilized in conjunction with the greater testing script that Gabe produced this resulted in findings of no statistical significance for cutoffs at every .02 increment from .2 to .3. There was some variation in the p-values but most hovered in between .25 and .75 for our current runs.

Due to issue with cancelling other peoples jobs using scancel on google cloud it has been decided that it Aaron will start all the runs and dump the sql database after which I will be use my auc code to create csv files with the aucs and then Aryender will perform statistical analysis on the results.

===Team Meeting Notes:===
The tests are beginning to conclude and we have some elementary statistics regarding final aucs for runs with adf on. The adf off runs have yet to be dumped but should be done soon.

Some of the mysql queries I used were
* SELECT generation, COUNT(*) 
<blockquote>FROM YOURSCHEMANAME.paretofront, YOURSCHEMANAME.individuals</blockquote><blockquote>WHERE individuals.hash = paretofront.hash AND individuals.tree LIKE '%adf%'</blockquote><blockquote>GROUP BY generation 
	ORDER BY generation;</blockquote>
* SELECT AVG(individuals.`FullDataSet False Negatives`), AVG(individuals.`FullDataSet False Positives`)
<blockquote>FROM YOURSCHEMANAME.individuals</blockquote><blockquote>WHERE individuals.tree LIKE '%adf%'</blockquote><blockquote>GROUP BY individuals.evaluation_gen</blockquote>For both of the above commands adding a NOT before the like will give the corresponding statistics for non ADF individuals.

Finding the average number of False Negatives and False Positives by generation for both individuals with adfs and without proved rather fruitless since without testing the only conclusions I could draw is they both have very high variances and are unlikely to be statistically different simply due to the massive fluctuation. On the other hand looking at the percentage and total numbers for individuals on the Pareto Front with adfs by generation revealed that there is steady growth in individuals with adfs on the Pareto Front as time goes on and adfs end up being present in over 30% of Pareto individuals in most runs which considering the current selection criteria is purely based off of frequency seems to indicate that adfs are impacting the evolutionary process in some significant capacity.

== January 6, 2020 ==

===Meeting Notes:===

Everyone from the ADF team last semester who still is in the VIP has decided to continue on with the sub-team. This semester we will focus on statistically proving our changes either positively impacted EMADE or had no effect/ worsened performance. We will need GCP or some other computing cluster in order to test and minimize unintentional confounding variables.


===Team Meeting Notes:===
Aryender and I will be working on the statistical testing of the data as well as extracting the necessary metrics from the database while Aaron and Gabe will be working on getting the tests running on a computing cluster hopefully gcp. Everyone should be coming up with ideas on how to either improve ADF's if the test show no improvement or looking into how to clean up our code base to more easily merge it into the master EMADE.
