'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Generic Algorithms Lecture:
** Goal: keep repeating the generation cycle overtime to try to find the best solution
Advantages of Genetic Algorithms:
Good for when the search base is large, discontinuous, and largely non-linear
Objective vs. fitness
For example, the objective could be the score a student receives on an exam, and fitness is how that score fits on a curve, in comparison to all other students
Selection
Fitness proportionate: The greater the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected for mating
The lowest fitness value has a probability to be selected
Tournament: several tournaments among individuals; winners are selected for mating
The lowest fitness value will never be selected because it will just lose in the tournament
Mate/Crossover: mating between individuals
Single point: swapping DNA between the two individuals at a single point
Double point: swapping DNA between the two individuals at two points
Mutate: introduces random modifications to maintain diversity
Algorithms: various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual
Randomly initialize population
Determine fitness of the population
Repeat the loop...
Select parents form population
Perform crossover on parents
Perform mutation
Determine fitness
...Until the best individual is good enough
