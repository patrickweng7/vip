'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Generic Algorithms Lecture:
** Goal: keep repeating the generation cycle overtime to try to find the best solution
** Advantages of Genetic Algorithms:
*** Good for when the search base is large, discontinuous, and largely non-linear
** Objective vs. fitness:
*** For example, the objective could be the score a student receives on an exam, and fitness is how that score fits on a curve, in comparison to all other students
** Selection:
*** Fitness proportionate: The greater the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected for mating
*** The lowest fitness value has a probability to be selected
** Tournament: 
*** Several tournaments among individuals
*** Winners are selected for mating
*** The lowest fitness value will never be selected because it will just lose in the tournament
** Mate/Crossover: 
*** Mating between individuals
*** Single point: swapping DNA between the two individuals at a single point
*** Double point: swapping DNA between the two individuals at two points
** Mutate: introduces random modifications to maintain diversity
** Algorithms: various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual
*** Step 1: Randomly initialize population
*** Step 2: Determine fitness of the population
*** Step 3: Repeat the loop...
**** Select parents form population
**** Perform crossover on parents
**** Perform mutation
**** Determine fitness
*** End the loop until the best individual is good enough

* Python notebook setup
** Find labs on Github -> raw -> save with type .ipynb
** Open the saved lab file with Jupyter notebook
