'''Lab 1 Notes:'''
* I was introduced to Python's Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python and applied it the specific scenarios of making a list with all 1's and the chessboard example.
* I used the Python's pip tool to download the deap package and tested ran the notebook in the jupyter notebook.
* I learned more about the crossover functions and how they must be custom-designed for particular scenarios.

'''Team Meeting:'''
* Learned about Genetic Algorithms in a Tree Perspective, where genomes consist offunctions and inputs in a list rather than inputs and one eval function
* Additionally we learned about custom primitive functions to simplify complex tree genomes
