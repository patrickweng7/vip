**Team Meeting Notes:**
* With genetic algorithms, each new generation is created through mating/mutation of individuals in the process.
* Keywords:
	* Individual: One specific candidate in the population
	* Population: group of individuals whose properties will be altered.
	* Objective: a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize
	* Fitness:  relative comparison to other individuals.
	* Evaluation: a function that computes the objective of an individual. 
	* Selection: represents 'survival of the fittest'; gives preference to better individuals therefore allowing them to pass on their genes.
		* Fitness Proportionate: Great fitness value means higher the probability of being selected for mating.
		* Tournament: Several tournaments among individuals; winners are selected for mating.
	* Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
	* Mutate: introduces random modifications; purpose is to maintain diversity
	* Algorithms: various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual
		* Randomly initialize population
		* Determine fitness of population
		* Repeatâ€¦.
			1. Select parents from population
			2. Perform crossover on parents creating population
			3. Perform mutation of population
			4. Determine fitness # of population
		* Until best individual is good enough.
