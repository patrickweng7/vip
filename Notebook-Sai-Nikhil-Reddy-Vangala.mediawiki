=== Lecture Notes (8/25) ===
* With genetic algorithms, each new generation is created through mating/mutation of individuals in the process.
* Keywords:
** Individual: One specific candidate in the population
** Population: group of individuals whose properties will be altered.
** Objective: a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize
** Fitness:  relative comparison to other individuals.
** Evaluation: a function that computes the objective of an individual. 
** Selection: represents 'survival of the fittest'; gives preference to better individuals therefore allowing them to pass on their genes.
*** Fitness Proportionate: Great fitness value means higher the probability of being selected for mating.
*** Tournament: Several tournaments among individuals; winners are selected for mating.
** Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
** Mutate: introduces random modifications; purpose is to maintain diversity
** Algorithms: various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual
*** Randomly initialize population
*** Determine fitness of population
*** Repeatâ€¦.
**** Select parents from population
**** Perform mutation of population
****Determine fitness # of population
*** Until best individual is good enough.
