'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Introduced to the Automated Algorithm Design VIP
* Reviewed Syllabus, learned about Notebook documentation, and informed about 10 week Bootcamp plan
* Learned about Genetic Algorithms through first lesson
** Individual - one specific candidate in the population (with properties such as DNA)
** Population - a group of individuals whose properties will be altered
** Objective - a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize (usually the goal is to increase objective through the evolutionary algorithm)
** Fitness - relative comparison to other individuals (how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to the rest of the population)
** Evaluation - a function that computes the objective of an individual
** Selection - represents "survival of the fittest" (gives preference to better individuals, therefore allowing them to pass on their genes)
** Fitness Proportionate - the greater the fitness value, the higher the probability of being selected for mating
** Tournament - several tournaments among individuals (number of individuals in each tournament is dependent on tournament size); winners are selected for mating
** Mate/Crossover - represents mating between individuals
** Mutate - introduces random modifications (purpose is to maintain diversity)
** Algorithms - various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual
* Received Introduction to our first lab

* Additional preparation before final presentation
** Rehearsed my portion of pickling slide
* Everyone gave their power-point presentation at the front of the room for each subteam
* Presented our final presentation for Viz subteam
* I was really interested in the Stock Market subteam
** The results between the statistical algorithms they highlighted and the machine learning models were intriguing
** They made a lot of financial primitives
* Overall, I particularly enjoyed my first semester being on the Automated Algorithm Design VIP team and believe that I deserve an A from the progress I made during the semester from where I started in the beginning
** At first I did not know what to expect because I had no machine learning experience in the past
** During the bootcamp, I was able to learn lots of aspects of machine learning and genetic programming with the labs and teaching presentations
** It was definitely helpful to have the bootcamp because it really helps you ease into EMADE
** I spent a lot of time trying to get rid of errors that were happening on my computer to get EMADE running which helped me problem solve a lot
** It was very interesting to work on the Viz subteam to see how they visualize a lot of EMADE and it was a good learning experience to work on the pickling to get a better understanding of the codebase and from the feedback I recieved earlier I wanted to continue keeping up my notebook and adding to its usability as I'm very willing to learn
* Thank you so much for a great semester!

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* We met up for our Saturday meeting and figured out our next meeting would be Friday
* I met some of the time conflict people interested in NLP
* It seems like we do not have access to Google Cloud Credits (GCP) yet
* We found out that there may be some discrepancy between Mohans NLP branch and EMADE master branch
* Initially we thought it would be excellent to utilize GCP, but since we don't have that yet we will run it individually
* Mohan went to the whiteboard to explain several concepts such as Bag of Words to the team which helped me more fully understand 
* On my local verson of EMADE I was not able to git pull for some reason because of specific errors
** Therefore I think I will reinstall EMADE on my computer
** Reinstall Anaconda because that too was not working correctly
* The time conflicts still need to figure out what they are going to do but we discussed some potential options with them
* My machine learning skills and NLP skills are very beginner so I decided to buy a book on NLP and try to do some outside practice with machine learning
* Hopefully by the end of the semester my skills in these areas will have dramatically improved

** Lemmitization goes to default part of speech is not specifically tagged
** Most lemmatizers take in POS as an argument in addition to the word
** It will be more accurate if we can tag words and insert these into the parameter of the lemmatizer 
* I also finished chapter 1 of my NLP Book
** Natural Language Processing In Action by Hobson Lane

** Porter stemmer
*** stemmer = PorterStemmer()
** Snowball stemmer
*** stemmer = SnowballStemmer("english")
** https://www.nltk.org/howto/stem.html
** Its interesting to consider how this can be implemented in multiple languages to analyze text

* Final Presentations were today
** We had a joint text classification and text summarization presentation for the nlp application overall group
* Over the weekend I was able to successfully run a baseline test of textblob on the imdb dataset to compare with emade
** For some reason it was initially going to take over 30 hours to run the script but I got it down 13 hours
** I split up the script to run two at the same time to utilize two of my cpu threads at once
** Plugging my computer in helped speed things up as well
** It seems that the textblob function I was using took a long time to run
*** In the future it may be more efficient to run the PatternAnalyzer from textblob instead of the naiveBayesClassifier I used

** It was a great year because I learned a lot about NLP, which has been a topic I have been interested in for a while and always wanted to undertake
*** My jupyter notebook skills dramatically increased as well with the help of my team members
** I also got a lot more experience working with emade building primitives for text classification

** Wikipedia toxicity dataset
** Chest X ray dataset
** They want to find configurations of DNN that are innovative and that can perform well, find practical and small configurations, and make it possible to find configurations without domain expertise
** Takes heavy use of CoDeepNEAT which is based on NEAT
** Composed of algorithm, system, and problem-domain layer
** Compares very well to other automl methods and provides insight to feasibility of this approach

*** https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/tree/nlp-nn/first_sem/toxic
*** It uses glove vectors which seem to help out a lot
**** <nowiki>https://www.kaggle.com/terenceliu4444/glove6b100dtxt</nowiki>
*** Single Output Layer
** In addition to the notebook, there is a helpful article that the first semesters can follow as a guide
*** https://stackabuse.com/python-for-nlp-multi-label-text-classification-with-keras/
* Reagan prepared the Chest X ray notebook for the 1st semesters to go through
** The amount of data was massive so we decided to split it into a subset of 50 images to make it easier to work with
* First semesters will choose one of these from a poll in slack and complete them individually and play around with them
**[[files/Slackpoll.png|none|thumb]]
* Check back in on Friday for progress and questions, notebooks due monday
* I will work on incorporating bounding boxes for the chest x ray for next week

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* It sounds like a lot of the first semesters chose the toxicity dataset
** Some of them were done by Friday
** 98% was the highest anyone was able to get on that dataset
** None of them had any major problems
* The ones who finished early, they will work on something on the nlp todolist
** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vGWQpaWf8FM4PDnd7EG04vEDL_XD7tkP4nuKf33Q3gY/edit
* My task is to continue working on the bounding boxes for the chest x ray
** Even though we are currently using a 50 image subset, once we expand this may prove very useful
** Around 1000 images in a csv format with bouding boxes
* Anish has some good progress with colab, hopefully we can test it next week

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Anish got colab working
** With regards to the mysql issue he recommends port forwading or using remote sql
*** https://remotemysql.com/
*** Comes with 100mb of storage
** I will explore the remote mysql option
I was able to crop images using bounding box dimensions
* [[files/Bbox.png|none|thumb|Bbox Dimensions]][[files/Xray.png|none|thumb|Original X-ray]][[files/Bboxnew.png|none|thumb|X-ray with bounding box]][x y] are coordinates of each box’s topleft corner. [w h] represent the width and height of each box.
* So from the given bounding box we can create a new crop of the image focusing on the new slice
* For around a 1000 images we are given the data above along with the Image Index and Finding Label
* The problem is that all the bounding boxes are all of different sizes so this will not be able to be directly inserted into our approach
* Solution I will use is find the maximum size bounding box and apply that size to the rest of the images
** This way there will be a standard size
* Busy week for me with exams and assignments will most likely be working on it later in the week

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* I set up my remote mysql account
** Its nice because it is free and comes with 100mb of storage
** You can have multiple databases as well
** I think anish found a pretty good solution[[files/Remote.png|none|thumb]]
** I will continue setting up my colab for next week
* In terms of the bounding box, Reagan found out that using r-cnn might fix our issue with the bouding box size
** Essentially we would be warping the bounding box images so the various sizes are not as important
** [[files/Rcnn.png|none|thumb|R-CNN Diagram]]
** I'm going to look into the r-cnn approach for next week and figure out how we can implement it
** Peer evals are open now, I need to complete those as well
** For the toxicity notebook it seems like the accuracy metric was causing the high percentage of 98%
*** Due to multilabel because it would output 5/6 accuracy when it should be 0% in actuality
*** This means eval function needs to be adjusted to account for this

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* During scrums Gabe mentioned that he has been working with bounding boxes
** He told me that he's been implementing a YOLO network as a primitive in EMADE
** Hopefully this can align with what I'm doing with the bounding boxes
** I explained to him the context of our problem and the direction I was going to solve it in with a r-cnn
** He noted that although this can work it may have long training and evaluation times
** Once he's done going to let me know
* My goal is to read more up on the r-cnn and figure out the image warping I need to do
* Sounds like Pulak was able to get about 4 runs in
* We are going to meet up on Friday as usual and go over things about the presentation
* Everyone is tasked for this final stretch

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Met today and will meet again on Sunday to go over slides all together
** I have a conflict at 3:30pm but am able to meet the rest of the day
* I researched r-cnn to more detail
** Read paper for rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation where they go over r-cnn and image warping
*** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524.pdf
*** Appendix A goes into some brief high level overview of a few image warping methods
*** Essentially the convolutional neural network requires a fixed-size input size in this case of 227×227
**** They take the image decide whether to scale it isotropically or anisotropically, the latter of which is the "warp" we want
*** Their proposed system takes an image input, extracts around 2000 bottom up region proposals, calculates features for each proposal using a large CNN, and then classifies each region using SVMs
*** Regardless of the region size they can warp the image to a square to feed it into a CNN
*** [[files/Warped.png|none|thumb]]Here is some warped training samples they used
*I pushed my jupyter notebook which illustrates the progression of the methods in a visual manner testing on a sample chest x ray picture
**https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/blob/nlp-app/testing/BBox%20Image%20Cropping%20%26%20Warping.ipynb 
* I wanted to add the image warping into the neural network methods but for some reason I had significant trouble with my git checkout
** It would checkout and then just stop and have issues with file changes
** [[files/Emade checkout issue.png|none|thumb]]
** Mohan suggested that I clone a specific branch but the issue persisted
** After some more attempts I switched my terminal applications and it fixed the problems

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* We went over the slides as a group with whoever was available
* I pushed my updates to https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/blob/nlp-nn/src/GPFramework/neural_network_methods.py
** After figuring out my issue on Friday with git checkout I was finally able to add my methods
*** bbox_grid, crop_img, and warp_img
*** At first I thought there was something wrong with my cropping method because I thought the size of the image it was returning was wrong
**** Turns out it was the right size, I mistook the ending bottom-right coordinates as the size
* Since I was working on these image based methods I wanted my slide to reflect that in a visual way
** The goal is to illustrate the orginal image to the cutting out of the crop to the specified warp

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* I never completely understood ADF subteam until this presentation
** Goal to improve EMADE by reusing useful subtrees of individuals
** Make individual trees easier to understand and explain
* Research fundamentals made some pretty good progress getting pace set up and workers going
* One of the time conflict groups presented on num entities in nlp
** I found it interesting how this can be incorporated in text summarization with the num entities in a sentence making it more important
** PACE guide in their presentation seems it will prove useful
* I thought that the data augmentation aspect that ezcgp talked about is something to definitely consider when working with image data
** Technique of generating new samples from an existing small dataset
* We had some lag yesterday in bluejeans presenting
** So I presented with my screen, not sure if mine had any lag
** It seemed fine on my end
** Tried to follow similar format to adf team introducing ourselves
* Overall I'm glad with what we were able to accomplish despite the circumstances with coronavirus
** It was pretty difficult to trouble shoot because usually we can be in person to directly help
** Bluejeans was not bad when it came to screen sharing and we were still able to get our subteam meetings in on Fridays
* Its sad to see the semester to come to an end
** My favorite part was probably working with image data in the last few weeks and reading up on new papers
