'''Lab #1 Notes:'''
* Going through the One Max problem was incredibly helpful in seeing how all the concepts we learned about in our first Genetic Algorithms lecture are actually implemented to create a simple yet functional evolutionary algorithm.
* I understood why DEAP is such a useful library for implementing genetic algorithms, as its 'creator' allows you to easily define the fitness objective and individual classes, and it's 'toolbox' gives very helpful infrastructure to define the genetic operators of evaluating, mating, mutating, and selecting.
* Tracing the main method reinforced my knowledge of the steps of an evolutionary algorithm and how to implement them. We randomly initialized the population using toolbox functions we defined. We assigned each individual their fitness value using our evaluation function. Then we entered our evolutionary loop, which was set to run for 40 generations.  In the loop, we used our select function to choose parents (tournament winners). There was then a 50% chance of the parents mating using our mate function—a two point crossover. Our mutate function (5% chance of switching each bit) was then called on 20% of individuals. Lastly, the fitness is again evaluated of the new offspring population. This evolutionary loop ideally produces the best individual—in this case, a bit String of all 1's.
* The N Queens problem gave me further insight into the implementation of evolutionary algorithms using DEAP. Specifically, it gave me another example of how to use the weight of the fitness objective—this time making it (-1.0,) since we want to minimize the number of conflicts between queens. I also saw how to craft a more complex evaluation function, modifying and testing it to both maximize and minimize the objective in the domain. I learned about the partially matched crossover, which is applicable for this type of problem because it simulates swapping pairs of queens between two parents. When testing, it proved more effective than a two point crossover, as the latter would not retain the information gained from either parent.
* I implemented and tested my own mutation function for the N Queens problem. Since the motive of mutation is to maintain diversity within the population, I decided to make a function that gives an individual the chance of being re-generated randomly, with no parent influence at all. Though this mutation function did seem to be minimizing the objective in each passing generation, it was not as effective as shuffling the indices. I feel that since this mutation is so drastic, it can sometimes set the evolutionary algorithm back a little by introducing almost a completely new individual into the population.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Sub-teams gave short scrum reports about their progress.
* We quickly reviewed our Genetic Algorithms lesson from last class.
* We were introduced to the concept of Genetic Programming.
* We learned how Genetic Programming deviates from Genetic Algorithms:
** Individuals are now represented by Trees instead of Lists.
** Crossovers are restricted to single-point, and they swap subtrees between parents.
** Mutations are randomly inserting or deleting a subtree.
* We saw modern applications of Genetic Programming, such as Symbolic Regression, which finds a mathematical expression that best fits a dataset.

'''Lab #2 Notes:'''
* I ran all the code for the Symbolic Regression section of Lab #2.
** I saw how Genetic Programming differs from Genetic Algorithms by having our individual inherit from DEAP's PrimitiveTree class instead of a list.
*** I understood how nodes/primitives are functions, how leaves/terminals are inputs, and how we can compile a primitive tree from the leaves to the root node to get the output.
** I learned that symbolic regression isn't about fitting a function to data; it's about trying to generate a specific output.
*** We can optimize this function by minimizing the mean squared error.
** I learned how to create my own GP mutation.
** Here is the graph from my symbolic regression:

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Sub-teams gave short scrum reports about their progress.
* We were introduced to genetic programming with multiple objectives.
* We learned about key concepts such as the Gene Pool, Search Space, and Objective Space.
* We saw an example that demonstrated True/False Positives/Negatives.
* We learned about maximization and minimization measures.

'''Lab #2 Part 2 Notes:'''
* I ran all the code for the Multi-Objective Genetic Programming section of Lab #2.
** I saw how we can set a seed for randomization to ensure everyone produces the same results.
** I learned how to define a pareto dominance function and use it to visualize our objective space.
*** I understood why we create a random population of individuals along with a separate one for comparison—to sort the population by pareto dominance and plot our objective space using the sorted population, as seen below:
[[files/Sarthak_lab2_graph2.png]]
*** From this visualization, I was able to see how our goal is for an individual to be as close to the bottom right as possible, meaning it is dominating the pareto front.
*** Here is a graph of the evolution towards finding that individual:
[[files/Sarthak_lab2_graph3.png]]
** I also saw how to use DEAP's Mu and Lambda evolutionary algorithms, and how they control the number of individuals to select and children to produce for each generation.
** Lastly, I learned how to use DEAP's pareto front hall of fame to visualize our pareto front, like below, and how we can use the area under the curve to measure its performance:

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Sub-teams gave short scrum reports about their progress.
* We were introduced to Machine Learning and the Titanic Data Set.
* James ran us through a quick python notebook of a simple approach using scikit-learn to make predictions on the Titanic Data Set.
* We were tasked with making our own solutions to the Titanic problem and graphing the pareto front for them.
* We split up into groups for this assignment. I am working with [https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/Notebook_Shlok_Natarajan Shlok], [https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/Notebook_Nicole_Ashley_Derosa Nicole], and [https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/Notebook_Somil_Jain Somil].

'''Titanic Data Set Notes:'''
* Met as a team and analyzed the correlation between the various factors and survival:
** Embarked: Weak linear relationship between points and survival rate, but those in S and Q had a lower chance of surviving.
** Gender: Very strong relationship.
** Age: Reasonably strong relationship.
** SibSp: Unclear.
** Parch: Some relationship, not strong.
** Fare: Positive correlation between fare and survival rate.
** Cabin: Only 91 members had marked cabins. Those that had a marked cabin had a 2/3 survival rate in comparison with those that didn't have.
** Name: Things like length of name didn't matter, but the title associated with the name did, which makes sense considering females had a much higher chance of survival. For example, if Ms, Mrs, or Miss was in the name there was a high chance of survival. Mr., on the other hand, had a low chance.

== February 10, 2019 ==
'''Titanic Data Set Notes:'''
* I created my only solution to the problem by using the example code from class and adding has_cabin, a name_length feature, and removing embarked.
** 0.8101694915254237 with neural_network.MLPClassifier()
** Kaggle Score: 0.74162

== FINAL ENTRY ==
I feel that I deserve an A in this class. This is because I think both my documentation and team contributions are deserving of an A. My documentation all semester has been consistent and thorough, and I feel like I have done an excellent job of writing about my progress and including supplements like images so that other students could recreate my work. As a first-semester student, I think I made valuable contributions to my bootcamp team, as I headed the portion on using GP on the Titanic Data Set, and had to take on more responsibilities when one of our team members dropped the class. Once on the Stocks sub-team, I continued to make meaningful contributions, as I headed the coding of our new data parsing script upon which our ML approaches were based, which can be found [https://github.gatech.edu/nvananupong3/emade/blob/emade_stock/testCode/preprocessing_stock_new.py here]. For these reasons, I believe I deserve an A in this class.

I also feel I did a good job of addressing the midterm feedback I was given. In terms of documentation, I was told to include more "to-dos" and links to code. In every entry since then (around the time I joined the Stocks sub-team), I have included to-dos and links to code I was referencing or working on. In terms of team contribution, I was told my effort could be more consistent, and since then, I have done my best to consistently be contributing and engaging with the team.
