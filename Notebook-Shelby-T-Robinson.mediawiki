'''Team Meeting Notes:'''

Introductions from Sub-Teams:
* EEG
* Deep Learning 
* Data Visualization 
* Caching 

Introduction to Genetic Programming:
*Genetic Programming
**The same as Genetic Algorithms except mutation and mating are different due to change in representation of genome of individuals
**Graphs: tree structure
**Primitives : %,+,*,-
**Leaves - Terminals
**Genome tree itself is the function/evaluation
***Ex: 1 + (3 * 4) = (+, 1, *, 3, 4)

==== Team Meeting Notes: ====
* What is an algorithm looking for a mate? Accuracy, validation, having good hardware requirements

* Data set contains samples
* Classify them based on Data set

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* The Deep Learning team is looking for benchmark problems that could be used for a publication.
* Perhaps our application of for processing of cancerous cells would be a good application
'''Medical Application Sub-Team Notes:'''
* Discussed the application of cancerous cell detection with sub-team, and determined that we would like to move forward with the deep learning team
* Discussed how our current algorithms could work with the deep learning team.  Specifically how could our image processing and feature extraction be utilized by the deep learning team
