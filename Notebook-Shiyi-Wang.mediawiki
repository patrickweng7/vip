'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* There was no General Meeting this week
* We decided on Wednesday at 2 pm for our Weekly Sub Team Meetings

''' Sub Team Meeting Notes'''
* We organized our first sub team meeting of the year
* We discussed QA systems, and I gave a brief presentation on how they work, producing probabilities for where the answer in a given paragraph starts and stops
* We then made a brief list of steps to explore our problem with Question Answering Systems
* We assigned tasks. For Monday, everyone was to setup EMADE on PACE and start runs with the Amazon dataset.
