''' Sub Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Steven gave a presentation on how QA systems work, producing probabilities for where the answer in a given paragraph starts and stops
* Outlined steps for our problem with Question Answering Systems
** Setup everyone on EMADE/PACE
** Work with dataset, make it work on EMADE
** Implement primitives and infrastructure to make Question Answering problems work with EMADE
** Collect and analyze run results
* Decided on our goal as using EMADE to look for less complex, yet as accurate Neural Architecture for state of the art Question Answering Systems, similar to how BORT was made as a less complex BERT: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10499

'''Individual Progress'''
* Familiarized with Natural Language Processing and Question and Answering (QA) Systems.
* Attempt to Setup EMADE on PACE ICE based on [https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/wiki/Guide-to-Using-PACE-ICE Guide to Using PACE ICE] and Cameron Whaley's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LashYCCJF3E PACE ICE Setup] video.
** Getting On PACE - Complete
** Transferring EMADE with SCP - Complete
** Setting Up MySQL - Complete
** Setting Up EMADE & Configuring the XML file - Complete
** Launch MySQL - Error
*** Experience mysql working only under campus ‚ÄúVPN‚Äù instead of physically being on campus (resolved through campus VPN)
** Launch EMADE on PACE - Error
*** Experience Import error: keras.backend.tensorflow_backend (resolved through re-setup)
*** Experience Disk Space Full issue: 15GB/15GB (resolved by delete all library and re-setup)
* Reflection on [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10499 Optimal Subarchitecture Extraction For BERT]
** By applying state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques, they extract the optimal subarchitecture set for the family of BERT-like architectures, as parametrized by their depth, number of attention heads, and sizes of the hidden and intermediate layer.
** They showed that this model is smaller, faster and more efficient to pre-train, and able to outperform nearly every other member of the family across a wide variety of NLU tasks.

* [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324802031_Algorithmic_Financial_Trading_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Time_Series_to_Image_Conversion_Approach Algorithmic Financial Trading with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: Time Series to Image Conversion Approach]
** They propose an algorithmic trading model CNN-TA using a 2-D Convolutional Neural Network based on image processing properties. 
** In order to convert Ô¨Ånancial time series into 2-D images, 15 different technical indicators with different parameter selections are utilized. 
** Each indicator instance gen-erates data for a 15 day period.
** The results indicate that when compared with the Buy & Hold Strategy andother common trading systems over a long out-of-sample period, the trained model providesbetter results for stocks and ETFs.
* [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9095246 Searching Better Architectures for Neural Machine Translation]
** Neural architecture search (NAS) has played important roles in the evolution of neural architectures.
** They propose a gradient-based NAS algorithm for NMT, which automatically discovers architectures with better performances. They search the network operations (e.g., LSTM, CNN, self-attention etc) as well as dropout rates to ensure better results.
** They show that with reasonable resources it is possible to discover novel neural network architectures for NMT, which achieve consistently better performances than Transformer, the state-of-the-art NMT model, across different tasks. 
** They discovered architectures could obtain  great improvement over Transformer baselines. 
** They empirically verify that the discovered model on one task can be transferred to other tasks.
* [http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/so19a.html The Evolved Transformer]
** Apply NAS to search for a better alternative to the Transformer.
** They construct a large search space inspired by the recent advances in feed-forward sequence models and then run evolutionary architecture search with warm starting by seeding initial population with the Transformer
** They develop the Progressive Dynamic Hurdles method, which allows to dynamically allocate more resources to more promising candidate models.
** The Evolved Transformer found in experiments demonstrates consistent improvement over the Transformer on WMT 2014 English-German, WMT 2014 English-French, WMT 2014 English-Czech and LM1B.
