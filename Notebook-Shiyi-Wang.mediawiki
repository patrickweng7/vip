'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* There was no General Meeting this week
* We decided on Wednesday at 2 pm for our Weekly Sub Team Meetings

''' Sub Team Meeting Notes'''
* We organized our first sub team meeting of the year
* We discussed QA systems, and I gave a brief presentation on how they work, producing probabilities for where the answer in a given paragraph starts and stops
* We then made a brief list of steps to explore our problem with Question Answering Systems
* We assigned tasks. For Monday, everyone was to setup EMADE on PACE and start runs with the Amazon dataset.

''' Sub Team Meeting Notes'''
* Portfolio Optimization and Stocks Team Brainstorming Session
** Research methods of visualizing technical indicators in neural net/CNN
** Extend on last semester‚Äôs work and focus on determining most useful technical indicators and EMADE configuration
** Add fundamental analysis methods to EMADE implementation
** Switch gears to Portfolio Optimization
* Literature Reflections

** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10499 Optimal Subarchitecture Extraction For BERT]
*** By applying some state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques, they extract the optimal subarchitecture set for the family of BERT-like architectures, as parametrized by their depth, number of attention heads, and sizes of the hidden and intermediate layer. They showed that this model is smaller, faster and more efficient to pre-train, and able to outperform nearly every other member of the family across a wide variety of NLU tasks.
