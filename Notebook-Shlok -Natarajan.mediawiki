'''February 2nd, 2018'''

Have completed assignments up to #4 (Titanic data set with sci-kit-learn) and will start #4 asap. In all honesty, I forgot about updating this notebook until it was discussed last Monday during the meeting. 
* #1 DEAP on simple problem notes
** Already had Anaconda and Jupyter Notebooks installed so only had to run a few commands to get everything else on the GitHub running. 
** Converged on an individual with all 1s after adding mod and absolute value to toolbox.
**[[files/Shlok Original Lab 1.png|none|thumb|Original fitness graph]]
* #2 Genetic Programming and Multi-Objective Optimization
** Chose np.mod and np.square as primitives with gp.mutNodeReplacement to register to the toolbox
** [[files/Shloklab2graph.png|232x232px]]
**[[files/Shloklab2paretofront.png|none|thumb|276x276px|Pareto Front Graph with area under the curve]]
** Originally got some runtime errors but fixed the bugs
** Original Area Under the Curve: 2.38
** Best: 0.69
*** Removed various combinations of primitives and this was the lowest area I got after about 10 attempts
* In class we talked about finding a mate and adding a bunch of important features to search for and how reaching the Pareto optimal relates to the types of features you choose, the number, etc. and how this all relates to defining feature choices in your algorithms as a whole (not just in finding a girlfriend).

* Subteam group met up at the culc yesterday and we went through the Titanic problem
* First, I went through all of the data and graphed it against survived to see whether or not there was a strong correlation. Looked roughly for outliers and clusters within the data and saw a few of the sort whic h eventually lead to the splitting of the fare dataset into buckets. I used plotly and seaborn to model the data using online tutorials for guidance.  
* The work is all documented in the boot camp subteam wiki report so instead of redescribing our processes here it can be viewed [[Bootcamp Sub-team Spring 2019]] under Group 3. 
* Unfortunately, we seemed to be getting pretty poor results no matter what we did and eventually decided to just call it a day as we had redone the whole process with different models and features twice and still getting results around .75 accuracy. As we got more accurate with the training data, I think the models just overfit the data and ended up with poorer results on the hidden dataset. If I were redoing this, I'd probably do more research on the models themselves and ensemble different models together, maybe even running different models on different parts of the dataset instead of just doing a blanket combination of different models. 
* I think I will redo this at some point in the future or at least try and work through another kaggle project except this time without using any examples for guidance.
'''February 17, 2019'''
* Used the given example of genetic programming from lab 2 as a template for the GP classifier. Unfortunately, I don't completely understand all the processes going on with the toolbox registration and would definitely not be able to reproduce this classifier from scratch. Need to try creating a GP classifier for another problem set and see if I can create a classifier.
* Our classifier was very simple and much like Lab 2 but one thing that seems to stand out to me is the influential factor of floor divide on the success of the classifier. In both lab 2 and this classifier, floor divide and/or mod seemed to allow for much better convergence. I imagine these cause a lot of values to become zero or one very quickly which makes sense why it would help in Lab 2.

* Successfully installed EMADE during last class. Haven't practiced doing a lot with it which is next on the agenda to complete. I need to read EMADE documentation or look through other peoples' projects with the library to get more familiar with it in order to create a Titanic classifier without just rushing without understanding.
'''March 1, 2019'''
* Unfortunately could not get MySQL running on my computer so meeting up with James to try and fix the issues. Getting weird errors when I get to the last step of the setup process
'''March 7, 2019'''
* Met with James and unfortunately no one could figure out my issue even with uninstalling and reinstalling everything.
* We're just running the EMADE stuff on Sarthak's and Nicole's computers and get data from there. 
* My job will more be focused on the presentation itself. Have put graphics and pictures into the slides as well as divided up responsibilities
'''March 30, 2019'''
* Met the EEG team and talked about roles going forward
* Scott assigned some books to read to understand the problem better
* Went to Emory with Scott previously and got muscular potential difference measured on my hand so have gotten some experience working with the lab.

* Met with James Wang and Kang to do primitive research. Unfortunately I'm a little bit behind everyone else knowledge-wise so hopefully reading Scott's book recommendation will catch me up.
* Current job is identifying papers with math that could potentially lead to a new primitive to use. Searching through NIH for papers dealing with TMS and the motor cortex
'''April 13, 2019'''
* I identified some papers that could be potential primitives, sent them to older members for them to verify. I don't think I fully understand the data we are recieving so I will try and get that clarified next meeting because searching on NIH/pubmed for primitives feels like I'm just shooting in the dark at this point
* If I get the go ahead from James or Kang I'll try and convert one of the formulas used in the paper to a primitive
'''April 17, 2019'''
* Found a lot of papers and compiled mathematical results/methods into a google document for others to read. One peer said that the papers all look like potential primitives for the next semester but that there is not enough time to implement them this semester.
* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcnwpCTE_8e3hpkSbOJXrZjXs0Gd68j1x--PI32e774/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=105701312335791436823
* Here's the link. About 4 papers all relating to EEG data and motor cortex activity.
* Preparing for final presentation
