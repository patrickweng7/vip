The second semester students met and discussed what team they would like to join for the semester. I decided to join the visualization team. We then broke into sub teams and discussed our team's goals for the semester. The visualization team decided we would focus on making the code more modular so that features can be easily added as needed. We also decided we would add additional visualization features and deploy the web app for use by the teams so that we could better adapt it to their needs and receive feedback as to how it is working.

The second semester students each gave a brief overview of what they had done the week before in a SCRUM style meeting. Our team reported that we had met and discussed some preliminary goals for the semester and ways in which we could improve the application. We subdivided a few tasks that largely involved adding people to the repository and group communication. We also agreed that everyone should try to get the code running and connected to a database. Some of the more experienced group members began working on various other components such as putting the code on Heroku and improving the UI. We set the next meeting time for the following Wednesday (1/27) at 4:30.

I worked independently to complete the tasks we discussed at the last meeting including cloning the repository and getting the app running. I did not have access to the Titanic Kaggle data set that the app was initially tested on so I wasn't able to use it to test the dashboard. However, I did connect to an empty database to ensure a proof concept for my installation. 

== January 21, 2019 ==
We presented on our progress during the general meeting including our ideas for the semester such as adding additional visualizations to the dashboard. We also mentioned how we would like to  deploy our application to other groups so that they can test the application, and we can make improvements based on their feedback. We talked about how we were trying to find a standardized method of collecting the data from the groups, and our intentions to set up a Heroku account to deploy the application to make it easier to use. 

== January 23, 2019 ==
Our sub team met to discuss what we had accomplished in a SCRUM style meeting. We each reported what we had accomplished since the previous week and any obstacles we had encountered. We further discussed ideas for the semester and the direction we would like to take the application. Additionally, we discussed several action items and divided them among members of our group. I reported the progress I had made getting set up with the visualization app, and running Emade to create sample data for running the app.

I worked independently to test the application with a populated database I had left over from a previous semester. This was the first time I was able to use the dashboard. I, additionally, worked on the html and css of the login screen to improve the aesthetics of the login and to make it more user friendly. I was not able to finish and push the login because I was still having some issues with the cookies.  I have attached a picture of what the login page looked like when I finished before it was plain HTML with minimal CSS.
[[files/Login2.jpg|center|frameless|This is what the login looked like when I finished. |500x500px]]

== January 28, 2019 ==
Our sub-team presented during the general meeting about the progress, we have made including setting the application up on Heroku. While doing so we encountered various obstacles  to having real time visualization as was our initial goal, it appears that this is going to be much more difficult so we may have to have users upload csv's for static visualization. Additionally, we added a toggle to easily switch between the main screen and updating pareto front. I also altered the html and the css of the login page to make more aesthetically pleasing and user friendly. We decided to table further tasking and individual discussion until our group meeting on Wednesday. Shown below are some of the additional improvements to the UI including tabs for the dashboard and pareto front.  
[[files/Full login.jpg|center|frameless|500x500px]]

== January 30, 2019 ==
We met as a sub-team and discussed our current progress and future goals. The main topic of discussion was the feasibility of using Heroku to host our app. We initially were interested in doing so to lower the barrier to entry so more people would use the visualization tools and not have to clone the repository and download flask. However, getting set up with Heroku also appears to be fairly difficult. We are having some issues connecting to a local database with the app on Heroku. Additionally, it would require a lot of additional code. We decided it would be best to put the Heroku endeavor on hold for now and to focus our efforts elsewhere.

==== Goals ====
* Test out the existing app and UI with data from other problems (ex: EEG emade data)
* Update the UI in preparation for testing and sending out UI survey
** Add navigation bar
** Fix URL redirects
** Aesthetic changes

==== Progress: ====
* Made some UI changes that will be pushed soon
* Got a copy of the EEG db data from last semester
* Everyone can run the app locally
* Heroku app is up and running but needs some bug fixes

==== Current Issues: ====
* App cannot connect to Google Cloud db which needs SSL or other authentication
* Heroku app cannot connect to a localhost db
During the general meeting, each of the teams reported their progress in a scrum style meeting including the addition of the newly created stock team. Our team reported on our current progress and issues including our findings on Heroku not being easier to set up than flask and the decision to direct our efforts elsewhere. We talked about the UI improvements we had made to improve usability. We also talked about our intentions to run Emade on a variety of datasets. Hopefully, beginning with the EEG team's data. 

== February 6, 2019 ==
Today, we held our weekly sub-team meeting. We discussed the progress we have made and any issues we are having in a SCRUM style meeting. We made several changes to the UI to make the interface more usable and aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, a guide was created for setting up EMADE-Viz with Virtual Environment. We also were able to add an additional visualization of the number of pareto individuals over time and fix some existing issues with the AUC graph. We also ensured the central repository was up to date and that all the branches had been merged into master and unnecessary branches had been deleted. We discussed and assigned a number of action items including ways to improve the current app and additional visualizations.

During the general meeting each of the teams reported the progress, they had made. We talked about trying to modify EMADE to create ancestry visualizations., and the many obstacles we had encountered while trying to do so. WE also reported on the futility of trying to get data from other teams. The data the EEG team had did not have the correct column configuration to be run with EMADE, and the first semester students had not begun to work with EMADE, yet so experimenting with other datasets is tabled for now. We are also working to resolve some issues with the UI updating while running Emade-viz and EMADE in parallel. We also worked to create a requirements file to create an easier installation process. After the general meeting, we met with Greg and discussed some ideas for additional visualizations. We also discussed the issues we were having in regards to tracking the individuals hereditary information.

== February 13, 2019 ==
Our team held our team meeting today. Some members were unable to attend and posted there updates via slack. Those of us that did attend discussed the progress we had made, and the issues we had encountered. We also discussed the ideas Jason and Greg had given us in regards to additional visualizations and how this could be implemented. We decides to add pop ups when you hover over the pareto front graph. Additionally, we discussed adding a number of individuals vs time graph. We also discussed the issues we were having with running EMADE and Emade-viz in parallel. We concluded the update time was about 1s vs the initial 30 s we had thought. This was obviously a significant improvement, although, we would like it to be instantaneous.

Today, we had our general VIP meeting. We discussed the progress we had made adding various features and visualizations to the UI to improve usability including the graph for evaluation times for individuals per generation and total evaluation time per generation. We also discussed the issues we were having including the futility in finding additional datasets to test on as we were unable to get meaningful results from built in datasets, and we have not gotten datasets from other teams yet. Additionally, we discussed the issues we were having with app being slow and our uncertainty as to whether the issues was the flask app, repeatedly trying to access the database, or local machine hardware. After the general meeting, we discussed with Jason the additional issues we were having with trying to pinpoint the hereditary information we needed.

== February 20, 2019 ==
Today, we held our weekly sub-team meeting. We discussed the progress we had made including the additional visualizations we had added and the pop up feature we had created. I discussed the error handling I had done  to improve the usability. We further discussed the issues involved in tracking individuals ancestry including the issues that arise from the intermediate generations during mating and the fact that a single individual can have up to 13 parents.

* Requested more GCP credits to help with creating the guide

== February 27, 2019 ==
Today, we had our weekly team meeting. We all discussed the progress we had made. I reported that I had made a place holder for the visualization of the pareto front overtime when Anthony finishes the backend. We discussed creating better documentation for our app and the features that we should include.

I worked independently to improve the emade-viz UI including updating the bootstrap templates css files and resolving the merge conflicts as a result of this.  Our team was not fully leveraging the template so our scalability was suffering as some pixel values were hard-coded. I changed these values so that when the window size is reduced the visualization scaled. Additionally, we had some issues with the dashboard being able to scroll horizontally. I  changed the hard-coded dashboard values to correctly scale as well. 

== March 4, 2019 ==
Today, we had the weekly SCRUM meeting. All the teams discussed there progress. We reported the progress we have made with tracking individuals ancestry . We met with first semester students to, hopefully, facilitate some sort of user testing for our interface. The majority of our team also got Google Cloud set up to run EMADE so we will then be able to run EMADE longer and test our visualization with more data.

==== Progress: ====
* Continuing working on a more detailed Google Cloud EMADE guide
* Met with a first-semester student to get feedback on our visualization app
* Continuing working on a slider so users can more easily traverse through generations in EMADE
* Modified SQL ORM to have field for the parent hashes
* Modified Master Algorithm to log parent hash during mating and mutating functions

==== Goals: ====
* Get EMADE data from other datasets
* Test ancestry fork of EMADE
* Have more team members running EMADE on cloud
* Store XML information in database to prevent hard-coding of dynamic column names
* Work on final presentation for progress so far and recruiting first-semester students
* Long term goal: allow the user to customize which graphs they want to see on their dashboard

==== Current Issues: ====
* New this week:
** Issues with creating slider to dynamically update graphs
** GCP issue with sharing bucket across projects
* Same as last week:
** Individuals can have more than 2 parents, making hierarchy visualization difficult
** Unable to get meaningful results from other built-in datasets (such as dota and wine)
** Live refresh of graphs not working while EMADE is running
** App takes a long time to load, even when viewing info from a prior generation

Today, we had our weekly team meeting. We discussed the progress we had made from last week. I talked about the changes I had made to login to notify users that they are logging in with invalid credentials. Additionally, I worked on forwarding from the login page to the dashboard to minimize confusion on how to use the app. Shown below:

Today, we gave our mid-semester presentation. We discussed the motivations for our sub-team including making EMADE more user friendly and providing valuable information for those using EMADE so that you can more effectively modify your code. We discussed the progress we had made both in regards to providing additional visualizations and the UI changes we have made to make our app more aesthetically pleasing.

Today, we had our weekly SCRUM we discussed the progress we had made merging our code and updating the login. Additionally, we had briefed the new members on the code and assigned them a task to get themselves started. We reported the issues we are still having with the hereditary visualization.

==== Progress: ====
* Working on merging code to combine new graphs with new login page (which has more useful error messages)
* Getting the new team members up and running with our viz app

==== Goals: ====
* Develop a way of storing data (like caching) to lower the number of db queries and speed up viz app
* Store EMADE's input xml metadata in a new table in the db (and then have queries search for column names based on that metadata)
* Hereditary visualizations and graph coloring
* Continued user studies once merging with new features is complete

==== Current Issues: ====
* New Issues:
** Working through issues brought up during the branch merges
* Old Issues:
** Still working on hierarchy visualization
** Unable to get meaningful results from other built-in datasets (such as dota and wine)
** Live refresh of graphs not working while EMADE is running
** App takes a long time to load, even when viewing info from a prior generation

== April 3, 2019 ==
Today, we had our weekly sub-team meeting. We discussed the progress we had made including resolving merge conflicts. Making forward progress with the hereditary visualizations and working on minimizing the number of database calls we make within the code. 
* Progress
** Anthony - Merged Sierra and Suraj’s branch
** Bec - Worked on speeding up processes through optimizing # of sql calls
** Carissa - Not too much because there were no user studies
** Jeff - Creating metadata table through emade
** Michael - Added colors to the tree graph so that the type of node can easily be determined, it’s also pretty
** Nicole - Worked on speeding up processes through optimizing # of sql calls
** Sierra - Worked on merging branches
** Suraj - Worked with Anthony to fix bugs with merging

[[files/Tooltip..jpg|none|frame]]
Today, I worked independently to add in the tooltips to the login to make the login more user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. One of the biggest pieces of feedback we got from our user studies was that the login process was confusing. I added in invalid credentials to help mitigate this. Additionally, I added a feature to forward users from the login to the dashboard to further minimize confusion.  Above is a before and after with the tool tips added. I also read an article on UX in web design to get additional ideas on how we could improve our app in particular in regards to UX. The article discussed taking the user in to account in every step in the design, and the necessity to compromise to ensure the integrity of the user experience. Additionally, it mentioned that using an application should be intuitive and enjoyable for the user.  

Article on UX: [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=9QC6r5OzCpUC&oi=fnd&pg=PT28&dq=user+experience&ots=mH39Hp8bZv&sig=TFCCg38bnSgS3dp5uKufMvPLK4g#v=onepage&q=user%20experience&f=false].

== April 8, 2019 ==
Today, we had our weekly SCRUM meeting we presented the progress we had made including trying to make our app more efficient by minimizing database calls. We also worked to fix our AUC calculation by storing XML metadata. To make our app more useful we added a feature to be able to export your pareto front graphs as well.

[[files/Tree Coloring Example.png|thumb|400x400px]]

==== Progress: ====
* Merged our feature branches into master
* New team members working on pickling db data for increasing app efficiency
* Hereditary visualizations in progress
* Storing xml metadata and using that to fix AUC calculation
* Graph coloring for tree structure almost complete
* Download pareto front graph implemented

==== Goals: ====
* Create new graph that finds columns based on metadata table
* Finish basic Hereditary visualization
* Merge all new features and test in preparation for end of semester
* Finish download graphs functionality

==== Current Issues: ====
* None for now
** We are just trying to get our app ready for the end of the semester to be merged in with EMADE

== April 10, 2019 ==
Today, we had our weekly sub-team meeting we discussed the progress we had made. I reported the progress I had made in adding in the tooltips to get rid of the paragraph of text describing how to login and to make the UI more user friendly. The new students discussed the progress they had made minimizing SQL queries by pickling data the effects of this update are shown below as well. 

Progress
* Michael - changed tree colors, fixed tree parser
* Suraj - did nothin’
* Nicole - looked over resources to get up to speed
* Sierra - Added in tooltips
* Jeff - fixed AUC, dynamic xml for auc
* Anthony - Implementing some of the changes from the user study, got resources to Nicole
* Carissa - worked on separating the visualizations into generational and aggregate

'''Determining Why the Pages Load Slowly'''

We should create a branch dedicated to optimizing the speed of page loading. We can test out one graph at a time and see what the load times are for the dashboard. That’ll let us know whether the bottleneck is certain graphs or the calls to the database.

Today, we had our weekly SCRUM meeting. We discussed the progress we had made and the current roadblocks we are facing with adding the hereditary visualizations. We also worked to add functionality to our app to export the graphs and making login easier by being able to login through uploading an xml file. 

==== Progress: ====
* Working on uploading the input_xml file
** Lets the user skip manually inputting the database info
** Gives our app immediate access to all the xml metadata even if the new metadata table is missing (until that code gets merged in to EMADE)
* Added some UI updates for clarity
** Tooltips with detailed instructions
** More user-friendly error handling
* Implemented pickling of database info for faster lookups

==== Goals: ====
* Determining why the pages load slowly
** Create a branch dedicated to optimizing the speed of page loading.
** We can test out one graph at a time and see what the load times are for the dashboard.
** That’ll let us know whether the bottleneck is certain graphs or the calls to the database.

[[files/Newlogin.jpg|thumb]]
Today, I worked independently to make some additional UI changes. I added default values to the login to give users a better idea of the information needed to login. Additionally, I decided to move away from the term "login" as rather than a login we are actually setting the cookies with the correct database configuration. These changes are shown below. I also read another article on UI design to get additional ideas on how to improve our dashboard. The article discussed the importance of organization which consists of layout, relationships, and navigability. One of the biggest issues we have had with our UI is the navigability. We want to make the UI as easy for users to use as possible. It is import for use that users are able to use the able with minimal training and that the organization and flow of the app is intuitive and logical. One of the most beneficial changes we made was forwarding the user from the login/data configuration page to the dashboard. We also added additional tabs to make it easier for users to navigate between visualizations.

== Summary ==
Transitioning onto the visualization team this semester proved to be a very educational and rewarding experience. I had a lot to learn to become familiar with the code repository. I hadn't worked with many of the technologies this team uses including Flask and the Bokeh library so my first objective was to become familiar with the code base and these technologies. After I had accomplished this, I worked throughout the semester to improve the UI and UX of the application to make it more intuitive for users and to increase the number of students leveraging our application. This team already had very established leadership that largely shaped the direction the team took. I contributed ideas and opinions during the meetings and worked to accomplish something each week throughout the semester. I revamped the login page several times adding a variety of features including more useful error messages, forwarding the user to the dashboard, tooltips, default values, and a variety of CSS to make the application more aesthetically pleasing. I also worked with Anthony to create an additional pareto visualization that we ended up not utilizing in our final dashboard. I worked for several weeks resolving bugs with UI caused by templates not being used correctly. Not all of this progress is accurately represented in the repo as I worked off of one branch for the majority of the semester, and our team’s leadership handled merging in into the master branch. In conclusion due to my consistent and substantial contributions to the team throughout the semester, I believe I deserve an A.
