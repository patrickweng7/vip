'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* First semester students will be completing a 10 week bootcamp involving various Machine learning/Python principles that will allow us to eventually work towards developing the EMADE platform and creating genetic algorithms. 
'''Lab 1 Notes:'''
* I spent much of the lab trying to better understand the DEAP Python Library, as I have no prior experience with it and some of the Python methods used. I learned about negative and positive weights, and how each attribute is used to create a functional Fitness class. The weights attribute must be a tuple, and can be any real number with the sign being used to determine maximization vs minimization. 
*The one max problem was an apt introduction to the basic functionality behind genetic algorithm, and I attempted to understand each step in the building of the final model. A population of individuals was randomly initialized, an evaluation function was define, and a generation size( 40 generations) was set. In each generation, individuals in the population had a 50% chance of mating and a 20% chance mutating. In each iteration, the algorithm was able to find an ideal population number to solve the problem.

====== Lab #2 Notes: ======
* I was able to witness how in Genetic Programming, the individual inherits from the PrimitiveTree class instead of from a list. After reading more about the DEAP package, I learned that nodes and primitives are functions that take the leaves of the tree (terminals) as its inputs. The order in compilation is leaves, then node, then output. 
* Within each primitive set, 'arity' defines the amount of arguments each primitive can take as an input.
** I was able to create my own primitive types for the tree, for which I used np.power and np. mod
* I am still struggling with creating GP mutation methods, but I will try to improve my understanding in the coming weeks
* My graph from my symbolic regression

== January 28, 2019 ==
* Introduced to genetic programming with multiple objectives
* Learned about defining and applying T/F positives and negatives. 
* Defined a pareto as an individual who outperforms all other individuals in a population on all objectives. The set of all pareto individuals is the pareto frontier.
* In a Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, lower Pareto ranks beat higher ones on the graph, with each individual given a strength S based on how many other individuals it dominates
** R is the sum of Sâ€™s of the individuals that dominate it. Pareto individuals are nondominated and receive an R of 0

== Feb 1, 2019 ==
* I also visualized our objective space, and have a basic understanding of how we compared populations of individuals by pareto dominance
* According to the notebook, our goal is to minimize tree size and Mean Squared Error as much as possible, such that the individual should be in the bottom right of the graph.
* Graph of the best individual:

*Finally, using DEAP's pareto front hall of fame I generated a list of the nondominated individuals after our evolution. This list and the last population are used to visualize our pareto front, with a lower area under the curve indicating a more accurate pareto front.

* I was assigned to Group 3 for the Titanic ML project 

* My submission was labeled Submission 4. It followed the same modifications as 3 but additionally changed the Split Fare into two sections, so that people in the higher end of fare prices would be prioritized in lifeboats but not so much so that even a little higher fare price would matter.
* 0.8372881355932204 with neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier()
* Kaggle Score: 0.68421

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Sub-teams gave short scrum reports about their progress.
* We began installing EMADE it with the help of Jason and James.

'''Installing EMADE:'''
* I had to install Git and Git LFS.
* I cloned the EMADE repository in an external hard drive, which is causing some errors in terms of launching the platform.
* I installed Anaconda 3, but still need to learn how to use a virtual environment for 3.6.
* I used conda and pip to install all the required packages.
* I am still working on installing a MySQL server and and learning how to configure a schema.
