*Introduction to VIP and genetic algorithms 
'''Lecture :'''

Genetic algorithms:  each new generation created through mating/mutation of individuals in previous population.

'''Individual''': specific candidate in population

'''Population''': group of individuals

'''Fitness''': relative comparison to other individuals (i.e. class rank)

'''Evaluation''': function that computes the objective of function

'''Selection''': survival of the fittest

'''Mate/crossover''': mating between individuals

'''Single point''': one point mutation

'''Double point''': two points mutation

'''Mutate''': random modifications

'''Algorithms''': various evolutionary algorithms to create solution/best individual
#Random population
#Determine fitness of population
#Repeat (loop for new generation)
#*Select parents
#*Crossover
#*Mutate population
#*Determine fitness
