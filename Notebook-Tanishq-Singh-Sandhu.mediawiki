'''Team/SubTeam Notes:'''

Final Presentations!

Here are my notes on the other teams:

'''NN:'''

I thought it was really interesting that the team decided to add a BERT layer especially since it is a newer, less mature technology- kudos to them on getting this added. 

Great that they found PACE documentation helpful and so they made more documentation for primitives being used in the NN group. Stocks team could definitely spend more time on documentation especially since it was hard to decipher the work of the previous stocks team. 

Also really liked how they worked on chest x-ray made runs- a real life implementation of emade that could help people. 

'''EZCG:'''

Found it interesting that they want to move away from transfer learning

Interested in seeing what changes to make to the new mating methods and also how they plan to integrate made into ezcgp. Also, the “how” makes me curious since excgp has its own way of introducing genetic components that would conflict with emade. 

'''Modularity:'''

Really like the results and the decreased bloat with this work, with Stocks a lot of our work didn’t necessarily give us tangible results (profit) to a decent degree

I wish we had conducted the stocks team in a similar manner- a series of “experiments” to look for statical significance. It seems more fit for VIP work.

I also am interested in the team’s next steps to evaluate diversity over time because I saw with ezCGP and some other groups that there seems to be very little diversity towards the ends of the runs. Perhaps introducing diversity manually can help us better evolve the individuals.

I presented the following slides:

'''Team/SubTeam Notes:'''

Dr. Zutty showed us how to write unit tests (src/GPFramework/UnitTests folder)

We had a ransomware attack on our data so we set up a new server and reran our code on the data

Finished off our second (stream data) emade run with the following results:
[[files/Stockssecondemaderun.png|thumb|none]]

Approximately 11% profit which is much better than  our negative profit in the baseline run.

Issues to consider: Concurrent buy/sell capabilities- because with our current methodology, once a stock is bought, the code has to sell as the next transaction.

Most of the meeting was spent on bringing the first semesters up-to-speed and giving them basic tasking to acclimate them to our work/repo. 

I will be working on creating primitives from the Technical Indicators we have implemented after consulting this example: https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/blob/CacheV2/src/GPFramework/signal_methods.py#L983

'''Team/SubTeam Notes:'''

Midterm Presentations this week!

Some notes/interesting points from other team presentations:
# Modularity
#* ARLs used to only be able to wrap around other ARLs rather than add complexity but now that has been fixed and there has been more complex ARLs.
# NLP/NN 
#* Interesting that they will be working on concatenating for adding complexity to individuals
#* Also thought it was cool that they are adding different crossover types even if there wasn’t any significant improvement.
# ezCGP
#* thought it was interesting that they also were having first years create primitives except they were creating keras primitives which may be a good idea for our first year students as well.

'''Agenda:'''
# Sunday we met with Dr.Zutty and Dr.Rohling for a dry run of our presentation. The main issue was our graph labels lacked specificity and we were unsure of where the data was coming from. For example we had labeled one line as "accuracy". Was it testing accuracy or training accuracy? So we went back and looked at our code and updated the graph labels accordingly. 
# Monday was Final Presentations!
'''Team/Sub-team Notes:'''

Some Notes I took during the Presentations:

ADF-

⁃ This team essentially reuses subtrees in EMADE to save time and efficiency

⁃ Area Under Curve Decreased when using ADF but not significant enough. Almost reaches significance(p=.05) in middle generations. Im curious as to why this is and why it decreases in the last generations.

⁃ Approximately 15% of ADF’s appear in the Pareto Front so ADF do provide a significant difference to the Pareto Front. 

⁃ Large percentage of ADF’s contain other ADF’s which is not good because it causes for over-selection

⁃  This was already mentioned for future direction, but I agree in that they should incorporate more data sets besides the titanic to see how ADFs perform overall

Research Fundamentals

⁃  The team added a bloat metric (normalized size change/fitness change) which is a metric for quantifying how much mean program size changes with respect to fitness (How helpful is the new code?)

⁃  I especially find this team interesting- its a unique idea to keep the code base efficient and concise

⁃ I think it would be beneficial to have a cloud lesson during bootcamp because many teams, ours and Research Fundamentals included, spent a lot of time on just configuring PACE and getting code to run on it

Natural Language Processing:

⁃ I like how they explained methods/layers such as Dropout, Conv2d as their method of explaining better helped me understand mine and some of my ezCGP peers’ architectures

⁃ Also a summary of Neural Networks was helpful. The background information made their presentation of their personal work more understandable and engaging.

⁃ An attentions layer works in parallel w encoding-deciding sequences of hidden layers

⁃ Toxicity Dataset Problem-( They were getting 99% accuracy but it turned out that if predicted data points were a certain percentage correct (expected (0,0,0,0), data: (0,0,1,0)) it would show the percentage correct, so in the previous example it would be 3/4 or 75% accurate rather than following the correct all-or-nothing criteria where the previous example would be 0% accurate)- this specific case they shared showed the importance of checking “why” and “how” a certain result has been obtained

⁃  I agree that incorporating ADF may render better results and I’m curious to see the outcome

Natural Language Processing Time Conflict:

⁃ Other NLP team works on text classification whereas time conflict works on text summarization

⁃ They had significant improvements moving to pace and I bet other teams would benefit

⁃ They made a PACE Guide Page! This is very important work in my opinion for collaboration regarding PACE issues

⁃ I found the TFISF Primitive a very intuitive way of analyzing the importance of a sentence. This primitive assigns a value to a word relative to its rarity of the word

# My Slide on my Embedded Systems CNN:[[files/EmbSysCNN.png|none|thumb|689x689px]]

== April 13 & April 15, 2020 ==
14th Class:

'''Agenda:'''
# 3rd Real Week for Online Instruction
## Go Over Presentation Expectations
# Monday Scrums
# Wednesday ezCGP Bootcamp lectures
## Mostly PACE debugging (attempted with peers but not successful)
## Kinerra Ran a standard ezCGP run for us to compare against

==== Team/Sub-team Notes: ====
This week was spent trying to run PACE:

Steps are:

SSH into PACE:

<code>ssh -X [null GTusername@pace-ice.pace.gatech.edu]</code>Setup SSH keys in Github (on PACE):

<code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>

(Copy the ENTIRE THING, should start with ssh-rsa and end with <code>[https://app.slack.com/client/T8AQ8LX5G/saved-page/thread/root%20something root something]@pace.gatech.edu</code>)

Go here: https://github.com/settings/keys

Click New SSH Key and paste into body (name is up to you). Now back to the PACE:

<code>cd ~</code>

<code>git clone git@github.com:ezCGP/ezCGP.git</code>

<code>cd ezCGP</code>Install Anaconda on PACE:

<code>cd ~/</code>

<code>mkdir ~/data/.conda</code>

<code>ln -s ~/data/.conda .conda</code>

<code>module avail anaconda</code>

<code>module load anaconda3/2019.10</code>

That module is the default, for now. Now create your ezCGP environment

<code>conda create -n ezCGP python=3.6 anaconda</code>

<code>conda activate ezCGP</code>

<code>conda config --env --add channels menpo</code>

<code>conda config --env --add channels conda-forge</code>

<code>conda install --file requirements.txt</code>How to use PACE:

<code>qsub runMPI.psb</code>

submit a queue request with psb script and run. MAKE SURE THE PARAMETERS IN THIS <code>runMPI.psb</code> FILE IS CORRECT. By default, it runs with 1 CPU and 12 cores on that CPU (line 3). CHANGE THE EMAIL to yours to that it will notify you and not me when job is done (line 10).

<code>qstat</code>

check status of queued jobs

<code>qdel [https://app.slack.com/client/T8AQ8LX5G/saved-page/thread/job%20ID job ID]</code>

stop a job and set to COMPLETED (you can’t delete someone else’s)

<code>cat ezCGP3.out</code>

output file in ~/ezCGP (will only be populated after job is COMPLETED

<code>pace-check-queue pace-ice</code>

to see how many cpus are running

<nowiki>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</nowiki>

Unfortunately PACE was extremely hard to work with and it went down during the week so we came to a consensus of running 10 Epochs locally and comparing them against the ezCGP run by Kinerra.

My 10 Epochs for Embedded Systems CNN:
* 65.67% Testing Accuracy (No data augmentation/pre-processing)
* CNN Graphs:
[[files/CNNGraphs.png|none|thumb|374x374px]]

As you can see, Testing Loss kept increasing and this was likely due to overfitting(algorithm concentrating on meaningless data and finding features from them)

# Second Real Week for Online Instruction
# Monday Scrums
# Wednesday ezCGP Bootcamp lectures

==== Team/Sub-team Notes: ====
This week we worked on finding/running our individual models to eventually compare them against ezCGP. 

Jason gave us more tangible homework/resesarch since we've been doing a lot of bootcamp:
# Find an image classification dataset (CIFAR-10 is okay too) and implement an existing architecture for it based on a paper (if not CIFAR-10, also find a paper for it)  "If you do use CIFAR-10, then one of you can use the CGP-CNN paper and copy one of their architectures in Keras. Keep in mind you'll have to run their architecture on PACE too. So you may want to make one folder for their architecture and submit a separate job for that one using a separate pbs script"
# hen run ezCGP with CIFAR-10 and compare the results (probably after like 48 hours for ezCGP)

# PACE was down for some time so we had to use our local machines to run the program. 
# Some errors I encountered:
## My environment could not find Tensorflow even though I tried reinstalling it multiple times
## My code request would time out but reveal no data
## PACE went down
# I implemented the Embedded Systems Convolutional Neural Network (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8612873/figures#figures)

# Monday Scrum 
# Subteam Notes:
## Monday was mostly to check in on our progress on our homework due Wednesday
## Bootcamp:
### 1st Bootcamp Lecture on Neural Networks
### Basics of ML:
#### Find something you want to predict (Survivability on the Titanic, Image Classification, disease spread, etc)
#### Find Dataset (Titanic Dataset, Cifar-10)
#### Split Data into Train, Test, and Validation Sets (Neural Networks can take a long time to train)
#### Train Model
##### Network predicts a label.
##### We use the “ground truth”  with predicted label to generate a loss.
##### We update the model parameters to minimize this loss
##### Repeat
#### Test the performance of the model on the held out test set
### Perceptron (neuron) in Neural Networks [[files/NeuronDiagram.png|none|thumb|436x436px]]

# Homework:[[files/HW3-23.png|none|thumb|463x463px]]
### Perceptron- 'a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features in the input data'
### Activation Function- "Activation function decides, whether a neuron should be activated or not by calculating weighted sum and further adding bias"
### Epoch- One cycle through training data set
### Optimizer- "'''Optimizers''' also apply the gradient to the neural network — they make the network learn."
### SGD-Here's my slide from bootcamp presentations:
### [[files/MLPPSlideSGD.png|none|thumb|570x570px]]
### Overfitting- focusing in on 'noise' of data set and trying to create features from them. It is harmful because it can mess up the optimization of your algorithm by focusing on data that has no significance.

# "Trial" Week for Online Instruction 
# Sub-team Assignments 
# Sub-team Break Out Session 

=== Team/Sub-team Notes: ===
# The BlueJeans meeting worked without issue and I was glad to be able to get back to a somewhat normal routine. 
# Got my Subteam Assignment... ezCGP! This was my first choice so I'm super excited. 
# Subteam Notes:
## Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)
## This group is working to use genetic programming to evolve neural networks
## The ezCGP code is quite complex for first years, so the existing team will hold one month of "training" to onboard us and bring us up to speed so we can contribute better in upcoming semesters
## ezCGP Code Structure:
##[[files/ImageezCGPcode structurediagram.png|none|thumb|598x598px]]
## For us, they've started a Wednesday Session in which we first-semesters learn separately.
## 1st Wednesday Bootcamp Lecture was a refresher on Genetic Programming and Genetic Algorithms from earlier in the semester (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uyCKKcVulDN0uEIi8WR2CFQVsAPTPvaE/edit#slide=id.p1)
### How ezCGP differs from Genetic Programming: "CGP represents DAGs (directed acyclic graph) implemented by a linear genome of functions, represented by integers, that operate on inputs to that gene. Inputs can be from a problem input or any previous node."

# EMADE Presentations! 

=== Team/Sub-team Notes: ===
Here are my observations from presentations (BC stands for Bootcamp Group):

'''BC1:'''
* Really cool how they created a time-lapse Pareto Front that ran through 40 generations
* Also really like how they went into depth in different ml models in their tree such as Planck-taper Window Function
* Really liked how they compared AUC and Pareto Fronts  for ML and GP and EMADE
'''ADF (Automatically Defined Functions):'''
* A function that is dynamically evolved and can be called by other functions
* They all spoke so well and were so thorough about their research
* Cloud Computing & ML
* Thursdays 4:30-5:30
'''BC 3:'''
* Liked how they found that parent and child values were ineffective but together (family size) they proved to be effective in Survival prediction
* A detailed list of EMADE showed all of their work and problem solving which I found impressive
* Like how they overlayed GP, ML, and EMADE Pareto Fronts
'''NLP APP/NN non time conflict:'''
* Natural Language Processing
* 2 Areas: Text Classification / Neural Networks
* NN- Biologically Inspired
* 4:30 Fridays Learn more about Neural Networks, NLP Models, HPC
'''BC 2:'''
* Slide 3 was a good visual and helped me better understand EMADE’s Master/Worker system
* A thorough description of adaboost was nice because it appeared a lot
'''Research Fundamentals:'''
* (Bloat Control)
* Bloat is increase in mean programming size without corresponding in fitness

* Focuses in core parts of EMADE Friday 1:15
'''ezCGP- Deep Learning'''
* I thought it was cool from a personal perspective applying emade to recognize images.
'''BC 4:'''
* Liked how they explained in layman terms their findings- why their results were off/why ML was better than EMADE
'''BC 5:'''
* (My Team)
'''NLP Time-Conflict'''
* Emade didn’t handle text data before these guys
* PACE- Clustering to use multiprocessing to speed up computing
* They rank a word’s importance based on its rarity- use this to calculate importance of a sentence (divided by length).
* Friday @ 4pm

# Presenting our Genetically Programmed Titanic Classifiers!! 

=== Team/Sub-team Notes: ===
* I felt we really presented well and had substantial content/findings to present to the class
* I only wish we had some extra time because I had a detailed slide about Stochastic Gradient Descent but had to rush through it.
Particular things I enjoyed/found-interesting from each presentation:
* 1st presentation- I like how they used their findings and found real events to justify, for example: Women and Children were given priority to life boats and thus were given a higher chance to live in the genetic algorithm
* 2nd presentation- (My group)
* 3rd presentation- This group spoke especially well in my opinion
* 4th Presentation- This group found GP was more accurate than ML which wasn’t consistent with the previous two presentations- wonder why...
* 5th presentation: Interesting that they dropped cabin during data clean up- I would think your cabin tells about your social class and thus your priority to accessing lifeboats

=== Team Notes: ===
* Walked though Pareto code
* Technical Presentations are different from normal presentations in that they need to be as detailed as possible- don't be afraid to have a lot of words and content on a slide
* Each Slide should have a one sentence takeaway and page numbers in case the audience has a question later
* Graphs should be large and clearly visible/labled

=== '''Sub-Team Notes:''' ===
* Finally met my sub-team and introduced myself
* Caught up on what I missed when I was out with the flu- Using ML Classifier to predict who survived on the Titanic
* Was informed that after creating my ML Classifier Code for week 5 using Genetic Programming, I need to create a slide on it to present next week:

=== Team Notes: ===
* You evaluate a genome by a set of scores:
** True Positive Rate (True Positive/Positive)
** Positive Predicted Value( True Positive / ( True + False Positive)
** False Neg Rate (False Positive/Negative)
** False Positive Rate (1 - Total Negative Rate)

* Precision (Positive Prediction Value = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives))

* False Discovery Rate = False Positives / (True Positives + False Positives) = 1 - Positive Predictive Value

* Negative Predictive Value = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Negatives)
* Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / (True Positives + False Positives + False Negatives + True Negatives)
* Pareto Optimality: An individual is Pareto if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives-(a set of measurements/markers)

# Address Administrative/Lab Questions from the previous week
# Genetic Programming Lecture
# Begin Weekly Lab (Lab #2) In-Class

=== Team Notes: ===
* Difference between Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming:
** Genetic Programming - "individuals and solutions are computer programs (represented by trees) rather than certain quantities"
* Key Words:
** Individual: synonymous with genome, genotype, tree; made up of ''primitives'' and ''terminals''
*** Primitive: a function that operates on inputs and returns values
*** Terminal: a value that a primitive consumes
** Pareto: individual considered Pareto if no other individual outperforms it in all objectives
** Pareto Frontier: set of all Pareto individuals (lower rank is better i.e. 0 better than 1, 2, 3)
* Symbolic Regression: 
** Uses random data distribution and tries to fit - most accurately - the data with a symbolic formula
** RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is used to measure an individual’s fitness.
** Goal is to minimize fitness (decrease error) through each generation

[[files/Lab2Results.png|left|thumb|187x187px]]This week we were given a lab to better understand Genetic Programming. After 40 generations of the Evolution Algorithm I got the following results:

When I was playing around with parameters of the Genetic Programming algorithm, I decided to try and put the max number of generations(90). My best individual value came out to 8.586751538906953e-17 which was significantly less than the previous value.

Takeaway: The more you allow evolution to run (generation-wise) and allow mutations to occur the better chance of your best individual being more fit. 

- 

== January 8, 2019 ==

=== 1st Class: ===
Agenda:
# Introduce VIP and the Automated Algorithm Team
# Policy/Procedure
# Genetic Algorithms Presentation

=== Team Notes: ===
* Genetic Algorithms essentially mimic evolution- ''a process in which individuals mate/mutate and test their fitness (relative comparison) as the better individuals advance to the new generation until eventually a best individual is reached.''
* The above is summarized in this phrase- "Survival of the Fittest"
* New Vocabulary I learned
** Fitness Proportionate: the greater the fitness value, the more likely that individual is to be picked to mate
** Mate/Crossover: Synonymous terms to indicate mating
** Mutate: randomized modification
* Powerpoint summarized Genetic Algorithms to the following steps:
# Randomly initialize population
# Determine fitness of population
# Repeat…
## select parents from population
## perform crossover on parents creating population
## perform mutation of population
## determine fitness of population
Until best individual is reached.

=== Individual Contribution: ===
This week we were given the One Max Problem and the N Queens Problem in our Lab for homework. We were given the code to run and it ran fine. This lab gave me a visual of how genetic programming goes through evolution in multiple rounds whether it was the accumulation of "1"'s in the One Max Problem or the max amount of Queens one board can fit in the N Queens Problem.
