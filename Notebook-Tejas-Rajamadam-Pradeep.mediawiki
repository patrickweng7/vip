=== General Meeting Information ===
* Notebooks are due tomorrow Dec 3rd at midnight.
* Today is final presentation.

=== Team Meeting Information ===
* '''Stocks'''
** Goal: EMADE to help stock trading AI
** Inconsistencies with research paper
*** Inconsistent in terms of matching rules and methods the paper specified.
** Genetic Labelling
*** explored a method to develop trading labels using a genetic algorithm.
*** It is an Oracle
*** This approach was too dependent on the model's prediction before a certain time point.
** Technical Indicator Primitves
*** Simple moving Average
*** Exponential Moving Average
*** Moving Average Convergence and Divergence
*** Stochastic Oscillator
*** Relative Strength Indicator
*** William's R%
*** Ease of Movement
**** What is EMV?
*** On-Balance Volume
**** Takes in opening price and closing prices for each day
***** Cumulative Balance volumes over 3 to 14 days.
***** The more days its tracks the better it becomes.
*** Bollinger Brands
**** Movement indicator
*** Commodity Channel Index 
**** Trend price level vs relative average price level over a period of time.
**** Can be used to identify areas where stocks are over bought or over sold.
** Compared Paper's run vs EMADE run
*** We think the paper's prediction was a fluke.
** Future Goals
*** run steam_to_feature on normalized data.
*** Test larger test ranges
*** Test more granular data
*** Improve genetic labelling
*** Find more research papers to read.
* '''EzCGP'''
** Base Code Development
*** OpenCV primitves
**** Thresholding
**** Normalize
**** Blurring
**** Filtering
*** Objective Scores
**** Focus is shifted to precision.
**** Previously used accuracy and the F1 score
*** Used Pace-ice gpu instead of pace-ice.
**** It took quite some time to link pce-ice gpu with tensor flow gpu and cuda gpu.
**** For tensor flow '''pip install is better than conda install'''
*** Genome Seeding
**** After each gen, save 20 best individuals as a pickle file.
**** They save the state of the current run.
*** Testing the framework
**** Benchmark the results vs CIFAR10. 60% training, 20% validation, 20% testing.
**** Results
***** run time: 53 hours.
****** 9 generations
***** Best individual stats
****** precision: 0.98
****** recall 0.97
****** F1 : 0.97
***** By analyzing the results it was found that diversity was quite low.
*** Results
**** AUC is very low for gen 1 and jumps really high to gen 2.
***** 0.92 -> 0.98
** NAS Research Code Dev
*** Super convergence
**** implementing a cyclical learning structure into EzCGP
**** Tensor flow has an add-on for cyclical learning rates.
**** Cyclical learning rates have shown to provide very quick convergence rate.
** Aging Evolution
*** Making individuals die by old age as training happens.
**** Increases diversity in the individuals. 
**** Two ways to do it
***** Early termination
***** Luck
** Future Goals
*** Experiment on block structure.
*** Experiment on MNIST
**** Image classification dataset with hand written digits.
*** Continue neural architecture search experiment
*** marry ezcgp with EMADE
*** Research new mating methods.

* '''Modularity'''
** Current ARL implementation
*** combination of nodes that are useful.
*** Search the entire population for combination of parent and children nodes.
*** Select some combinations of nodes based on their cumulative distribution function created from their frequency and fitness.
*** ARLs are selected based on frequency and distribution.
** Current Experiments
*** Differential fitness
**** Difference as the fitness of itself and its most fit parent.
***** positive value means a good child.
**** Favors higher differential fitness
**** Takeaways
***** converged with baseline at higher generations.
***** pareato individuals used ARLs but seemed to mainly pass primitves.
*** Alternate selection
**** Linearly scaled getting selected for a tournament with the number of ARLs it has.
**** Increases the number of ARLs.
**** Takeaways
***** Converged with baselines at higher generations.
***** No significant change to number of ARLs per induvidual.
*** Data Pair restriction
**** Test ARLs created only through the datapair fix.
**** Takeaways
***** No statistical significance
***** ARLs are intuitively more useful.
***** Did not converge with baseline
***** Titanic dataset may be limiting results.
*** Alternate selection
**** Added data pair restrictions
**** target is to reduce bloat.
**** Takeaways
***** Low sample size may lead to worse results.
***** Individuals don't have bloat since they have only 0, 1 or 2 ARLs
***** Unexpected result due to a low sample size.
** Experiment Setup
*** Running on titanic dataset
*** objectives to minimize false positives and false negatives
*** Seeded runs with 5 individuals
** Takeaways from experiments
*** Significance in generation 10-20
*** Overall ARLs are beneficial compared to the baseline
*** ARLs lower the standard deviation.
** Future goals
*** MNIST dataset experiments
*** Measure diversity over time.

* Currently our presentation is too long and are working on reducing the presentation length.
* I am working on two slides for the presentation, one for pace errors and one for adaptive mutations.
* We still have some unresolved errors with pace
** My issue with conda permissions
** And an issue with the python lxml package 
* We also had an out of memory issue
** First we tired to delete the .git file and some input datasets but that wasn't enough
** Then we tried to use conda remove to delete an old environment and its packages but that command did not work.,
** Instead we had to use pip cache purge to get rid of useless packages.

=== General Information ===
* Peer evals are now out,
* The grades have been transferred to canvas.

=== Team Meeting Information ===
* Stocks
** Finished the technical indicator primitves.
*** Plan is to run EMADE using these technical indicators.
** Results of genetic labelling looks good.
** Ran EMADE on the S&P dataset.
** Running more tests before final presentation.
* EzCGP
** Focus is mainly on baseline runs.
** An issue is that the algorithm is greedy.
** Working on finishing final presentation slides.
* NLP
** The main goal for this week is to run EMADE
*** Anuraag is working on running on Ice-Hammer while I and pulak are running on PACE.
**** 2 runs for a baseline on toxicity and chest xray
**** 2 runs with all primitves
**** 2 with all mating and mutation functions
*** We also need to parse thorough the out files for each of the runs and analyze area under the curve
** We have a repo to organize our results
*** https://github.gatech.edu/pagarwal80/EMADEResults
* Modularity
** Making a run on data pair limit experiment
** Beginning work on the MNIST dataset, 
*** Currently all individuals are having errors.
** Working on final presentations
*** Working on documentation
*** Making code base cleaner and more readable

=== Sub-Team Meeting Notes ===
* We are busy performing runs on PACE and ICE Hammer
* I am running into quite a few errors on PACE and we weren't able to solve them yet.
* We also brainstormed the out of memory error some people were getting on PACE
** Initially we tried to use conda to remove redundant packages and environments but that did not work.
*** '''conda env remove''' --name myenv
** Turns out that conda's remove does not work effectively, as even though it says successful it doesnt seem to change the memory
** We instead used pip cache purge which seemed to solve the issues.
* The CV team has created a document for their primitves:
** https://www.notion.so/Computer-Vision-Primitives-6f160347b15c4f3e8c0ccac10b9bc749
* All the setup is done for the x-ray dataset and is ready to be run on emade.
* We have began making runs on EMADE and the runs are on this github
** https://github.gatech.edu/pagarwal80/EMADEResults
* We have also finished pre processing the amazon product review dataset and is ready to be run on EMADE.

=== Conclusion ===
* I created the following pbs script to run mysql on PACE 
[[files/Tejas mysql.pbs.png|center|thumb|374x374px|tejas_mysql.pbs]]
* I then created the following launchEMADE.pbs script to run emade on PACE
** The issue i had here was normally you have to supply your conda environment in this script, but since I do not have a conda environment due to the errors from last week I left the field blank.
[[files/LaunchEMADE.pbs.png|center|thumb|438x438px|launchEMADE.pbs]]
* Both these scripts ran initially
* [[files/Pace run.png|center|thumb|551x551px|Scripts running on pace]]

* But after about five minutes the launchEMADE.pbs stopped running so I knew there must be some error
[[files/Stopped run.png|center|thumb|584x584px|Scripts after the run crashed]]
* I then investigated the toxicity-out file and found the following error
[[files/Toxicity out.file.png|center|thumb|526x526px|Error in toxicity out file]]
* I initially though the error was due to me not having a conda environment
** But i verified that the required packages were included
* Then upon searching online people suggested that I make sure that the inputSchema.xsd file and launchEMADE.py had no errors
** I checked them both for errors and found nothing.
*** I checked for any missing brackets but that wasn't the issue.
*** I also performed some trivial substitutions like double quotes instead of single quotes but it did not fix anything.
* I ran this multiple times and got the same error every time time.
* I thought the error could arise from some mistake on my part during setup so I deleted all my pace files and set it up again but I got the exact same errors.
** We discussed it in the sub-team meeting and no one was able to figure out the root cause of this error.

=== Conclusions ===
* I had to start setting up PACE from scratch
** Last semester something went wrong with my pace causing constant errors so I decided to start from the scratch.
** My cnf file
*** [[files/My.cnf Tejas.png|center|thumb|470x470px|tpradeep8 cnf file]]
** My environment.yml file
*** The file below is a pdf file, to recreate my results paste the contents of this file in a environment.yml file
****[[files/Environement yml.pdf|center|frame|Environment yml]]
* I also cloned the nn-vip git repo which has our current files.
** I used WinSCP to transfer the files and would highly recommend it to any windows users.
** Initially it asks  you for your login authentication
[[files/WinSCP Login.png|center|thumb|WinSCP Login]]
** Provide your PACE login credentials, then it opens into a window
** From this window below you can just drag and drop files from your machine to pace. You can also open files which are on pace through this and view them.[[files/WinSCP Window.png|center|thumb|WinSCP Window]]

* I ran into my first of many issues while trying to create a conda environment
** This is the error I ran into
[[files/Conda error.png|alt=PACE Conda setup error|center|thumb|454x454px|PACE Conda setup error]]
* I tried running this with sudo conda but that did not work either.
** I also reported an incident but they never got back to me about this issue.

* At first I did not know how to fix this error, though i consulted with the rest of the team on the #pace-support channel and during our sub-team meeting and was recommended to instead use pip installs
** The commands I used
 pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras scipy psutil lxml matplotlib PyWavelets sqlalchemy networkx cython scikit-image mysqlclient pymysql scikit-learn

 pip install xgboost lmfit multiprocess hmmlearn deap opencv-python.
** Initially I also had an error with pip, that pip wasn't able to upgrade but upon retrying the next day the error seemed to have fixed itself.

** The document can be found here : [[Guide to Using PACE-ICE]]
* I read through the paper on An Approximate Algorithm for Optimal Sub-Architecture Design
** The paper was very interesting but I wasn't able to understand all of it. 
** The paper was very math heavy and focused primarily on a proof of weather it was possible.
** The paper did not really provide a concrete algorithm we could try and adapt.

=== Conclusions ===
* The paper found here was a very interesting read
** https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08512
* The summary of the paper as best I could understand
** Basically they are talking about how even though over parameterized models train better, recently it has been shown that that it is  possible to remove several neurons for a deep trained neural network and it still  remains good. From a computational point of view, this suggests that, for a trained architecture, there exists a smaller version with a weight configuration that works justas well as its larger counterpart  OSE problem is the task of selecting the best nontrainable parameters for a neural network, such that it is optimal in the sense that it minimizes  parameter size, inference speed, and error rate. Intuitively, an architectural parameter is different from a trainable parameter because it is a variable which is assigned a value when the architecture is instantiated, likewise remaining unchanged  for the lifetime of this function. A change on the value assignment of said variable is capable of  effect change on the three functions we are optimizing over, even when utilizing the same training  procedure. 
** Major definitions in the paper
[[files/Def1.png|center|thumb|definition 1]]
[[files/Def 2.png|center|thumb|Definition 2]]
[[files/Definition 3.png|center|thumb|Definition 3]]
[[files/Definition 4.png|center|thumb|Definition 4]]
* Another very interesting section of the paper was a possible algorithm they described that could be optimal sub-architecture design
[[files/Definition 5.png|center|thumb|Possible algorithm for OSE

The algorithm was quite difficult to understand and was theoretical, hence we decided not to try and implement it.
]]
* The paper as a whole was a good read but was mainly focused on a proof of a possible algorithm and showing that the problem is NP-Hard.

=== Sub-Team Meeting Notes ===
* We are switching to use YOLO on the chest x-ray dataset.
* For novelty, we have two main options:
** getting better results than the CoDEEPNEAT paper does on the same datasets. For this, each member is exploring different avenues as brought up before. We don't have the attention layers, adaptive mutation, word embeddings working yet, but we are working on them.
** exploring a new problem that hasn't been focused on before and showing how EMADE gets great results on it. We spent some time brainstorming a significant problem to this effect.
* We are beginning to implement adaptive mutations
* We also assigned duties to the first year students.

=== General Information ===
* Midterm Presentation is on October 19th, from 5pm to around 730pm.

=== Team Meeting Info ===
* General Updates
** Stocks
*** Performed a run on EMADE with all the data.
*** Ran 52 generations of EMADE with S&P 500 data, found a min standard error of 10.387.
** EzCGP
*** Research Team
**** Working on our writeups and summarizing papers.
*** Implementation Team
**** Perform base runs and setup metrics
**** Define what to expect of EMADE runs in case baseline runs cannot happen in time.
** NLP
*** Stats notebook: 
**** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17vC-WvvFMBhG3y8yROE8qSIwhjMEWrdM?usp=sharing
*** Adaptive mutations, and shuffle layers are in progress.
** Modularity
*** Fixed issues from last week
**** We can now create ARl's that have ARGs
*** We need to perform runs with our new system.

=== Sub-Team Meeting Notes ===
* I fixed issues with the collab notebook so it can actually run emade.
* Still sometimes I run into conda issues and sometimes I don't, I am investigating why it happens.
** The issue is always package not found, but after a reload the issue does not com back.
*** I suspect it could be a package that is not very commonly used by EMADE primitves, but whenever it is used it errors out.
** Link to collab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bhRodLmoobRtAJFtrKLkGtR__wlHbB1Q
* We performed a run and here are the stats

=== Conclusions ===
[[files/Remotemysql.png|center|thumb|Remotemysql database]]
* Google collab conda environment is currently broken, working on fixing it.
* The issue with the mysql port forwarding still exists, maybe solving other auxiliary issues like the broken conda environment may fix it.

== September 21, 2020 ==

=== General Information ===
* Peer evals open next week. Notebooks due soon.

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* Stocks
** Research team
*** Discussed a couple of papers and narrowed it down to 2 papers.
*** Working on mirroring the paper's approach onto EMADE.
*** Planning on running EMADE on google collab and AWS
* Modularity
** Running into a cannot connect to MySQL database error.
** running into issues with PACE
** remotemysql website on working as expected, may shift to port forwarding.
* NLP
** CV has setup PACE, still an error exists with the conda environment
** new optimizers have be pushed into the nlp branch
** Reviewed paper on adaptive mutation: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s005000000042
*** The biggest issue the paper present is that is it not very feasible to implement within EMADE.
** Results with activation functions and pretrained embeddings mutation functions:
*** Best individual after 100 generations: 0.03555 score, individual: NNLearner(ARG0, OutputLayer(ARG0, GRULayer(55, sigmoidActivation, 10, falseBool, trueBool, EmbeddingLayer(94, ARG0, gloveTwitterWeights, InputLayer(ARG0)))), 100)
** Goals
*** Integrate adaptive mutation with EMADE
*** May shift from PACE to collab due to errors.
* ExCGP
** working on the new architechture
** testing loadig sampel data into ezcgp
** discussed additional ideas from papers.

=== Sub-Team Meeting Notes ===
* New mating function did not really improve on accuracy scores
* I spent most of the week reading and analyzing the feasibility of the following paper
[[files/MarsiliLibelli-Alba2000 Article AdaptiveMutationInGeneticAlgor.pdf|center|thumb|Research paper on adaptive mutations]]
* The paper talks about two different approaches, 
** parameter coding
*** Once each parameter is binary encoded, the new mutation strategy requires each parameter can be dealt with separately instead of as a group, hence the need for the unique encoding.
*** Crossover and mutations are completely mutually exclusive
*** The crossover operator produces two new individuals whose fitness is to be evaluated before a possible mutation is applied.
** New mutation operator
*** mutation will be highly depended on how good a current gene (method) is, based on its contribution to the overall fitness
*** Parameters with a high contribution to the fitness shall have a very low changes of mutations, as they are already good.
*** On he other hand methods with a lower contribution to the overall fitness shall have a higher probability of mutation
*** The scaling of the mutation probability factor to foster the mutation o0f lower grade chromosomes.
* The ideas form the paper are very interesting and doable, just the way they have implemented it is quite math intensive and might not be the best for us.

=== Personal Notes ===
* Reading a research paper on adaptive mutations, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220117106_A_Genetic_Algorithm_with_Adaptive_Mutations_and_Family_Competition_for_Training_Neural_Networks
** The paper is quite challenging to read, it is quite heavy in content.
** The method they use to perform adaptive mutations is not very usable as it is extremely slow, and performs extensive mathematical calculations in each iteration, making the process too slow.
* Completed self evaluation

=== Conclusion ===
* The paper i picked to research: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5473303
** The paper talks about 3 different operators to improve the adaptive mutations
*** Selection Operator
**** The selection method that lines up individual order between two generations is adopted to select optimal individuals in HRAGA.
*** Help Operator
**** In order to reinforce the ability of algorithm to jump out local optimal solutions and increase the speed of convergence, a help operator is used in HRAGA to help individuals according to the probability of help.
*** Adaptive Crossover Operator and adaptive mutation operator
**** Under binary coding mode, one-point crossover is a very effective crossover operation, it is adopted in HRAGA. Mutation means to choose some individuals stochastically from population under a small probability of mutation, then choose one bit or some bits of the chosen individuals stochastically and overturn their numbers, namely turn 1 to 0 or turn 0 to 1.

== April 20, 2020 ==

=== General Information ===
* Today is the final presentation.
* Notebooks due next Monday

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* ADF
** Improves on EMADE by reusing subtrees
** Primitive Analysis
*** Finds the defects of the ADFs in the population
*** Tries to isolate important components of an individual
*** passTrisatat is the most common learner primitive
** Selection
*** Created a tournament method that favors individuals with more ADFs
** Differential Fitness
*** Optimize search in GP
*** Measure change between an individual and its parents
* Research Fundamentals
** neat-Gp is a bloat control technique
** a lack of explicit bloat control provides a performance boost over conventional bloat control.
** Speciation
*** Species are assigned based on the shared topology of trees.
*** Species are assigned greedily
** Crossover
*** Identifies a common region between two individuals.
** Still not sure whether the distance metric is good for EMADE, due to tree shape
* NLP
** GloVe embedding
*** Primitives
**** Relu Layer
**** ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)
**** SELU (Scaled Exponential Linear Unit)
*** GloVe Embeddings
**** A word to vector mapping layer in a neural network
** Toxicity Dataset
*** could classify target as SPARSE
** Text Summarization
*** enabled EMADE to run on google collab
*** works on lemmatization and stemming
* EzCGP
** Evolutionary Parameters
*** Archived better test scores than similar models
*** Validation accuracy and F1 scores are close
** Discussed other architectures and their accuracies.

=== Sub Team Meeting ===
** Team presentation went well.
** This semester as a whole has been pretty good, but progress has been slow.

== April 3, 2020 ==

=== General Information ===
* This week is the first official meeting since the lockdown
* Blue jeans is working fine for now, but it is a little difficult to help each other fix errors through blue jeans
* Team members like Anshul who have left the country are finding it hard to meet at the meeting time due to time conflict.

=== Team Meeting Information ===
* We have realized that there are some errors with both the num_named_entities primitive and the tfidf primitive.
* Both primitives are extremely slow, probably due to calls to spacy methods.
** Also, the primitives have too many calls to the emade data pair.
** Moreover, loops through the entire emade data pair more times than necessary.

=== Conclusions ===
* As a whole, the semester was extremely rewarding and helped me learn a lot about new topics like genetic programming and data manipulation.
* NLP:
** I worked on the number of named entities primitive.
** Initially tested two approaches:
*** NLTK
**** Better identification and labeling
**** But slower.
*** Spacy
**** Worse identification and labeling.
**** Much faster.
*** For the purpose of number of named entities, the labeling is not important hence i chose to go with spacy's approch to number of named entities.
** Further implemented the primitive in EMADE and tested it with a large data set.
** Primitve was not very accurate, will work on fixing it next semster.

== October 9, 2019 ==

=== General Information ===
* Installation of EMADE.
* Installation of MySQL.

=== Team Meeting Information ===
* Introduction to EMADE
** EMADE: 
** Installation notes found in the README in the github repo.
* Running EMADE:
** Navigate to the top-level directory and run '''python/src/GRFramework/launchGTMOEP.py templates/input_titanic.xml'''
** The input file is an xml document, that configures all the various aspects of EMADE.
** The enst block in running is to configure MySQL, which will require username and password.
** EMADE can run across multiple datasets, but the titanic example uses only one.
** The data is preprocessed into gzipped csv files. Then it is cross folded 5 times, this creates 5 trials algorithms can be scored on. 
** Each train and test file creates a data pair object in EMADE.
** '''Objectives:'''
*** Names are used as columns ins the database.
*** Weight specified indicates whether a front should be minimized or maximized.
** <woreksoerhost> the number of parallel evaluations that run.
* Outputs in EMADE
** The best way to view EMADE outputs is using a MySQL database.
** datasets/ is where test datasets are available.
** templates/ is where input files are available

=== General Information ===
* Assignment: Use multiple objective genetic programming algorithm on the Titanic dataset.
* Peer evaluations due Friday October 4, 2019
* Notebooks due Friday October 4, 2019

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* Come up with a common feature set, using vectorization, whitening, and other data clean up methods to create a new feature set.
* For individuals, use simple primitives like +, *, -, /, %.
* Using a genetic algorithm, come up with a pareto front containing at least 100 co-dominant individuals.
* Plot pareto front, and Area Under the Curve and track its changes.

=== Sub-Team Notes ===
* The team meeting began with an analysis of Lab 2 and the DEAPAPIi.
* Decided to use Lab 2 as a skeleton for the assignment.
* Used basic primitives (+, *, /, %, or, and, not) to create our individuals.
* Result of the genetic algorithm should be a pareto front with non-dominant points.
* Decided to use selNSGA2 selection instead of selTournament, as selNSGA2 selection works much better with the Titanic dataset.
* Decided to use a strongly typed genetic algorithm rather than weakly typed algorithms.
* The notebook used is found in the google research collab link : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Kb7CTv_J9LeTJJIzNRU4STscfK-DkWIF

=== General Information ===
* Sub-Teams presented their co-dominant algorithms and feature sets.
* Sub-Team Presentations (Team 4): [[Bootcamp Sub-team Fall 2019|https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/Bootcamp_Sub-team_Fall_2019]]

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* Each team presented their code, feature set, and the pareto front.
* Strategies to clean up code:
** vectorization / encoding
*** used to encode a variable with a thee possible values.
*** Encoding with 1, 2, 3 is not good,  as 1 is further from 3 than 2, which may not be the case with the values of the variable.
*** Vectorization assigns the variables into a bit map, hence eliminating the distance problem.
** Whitening: Normalizing the data, so all variables will be on the same scale.

=== Conclusion ===
* Analysis of the data:
*# Around 70% of women survived
*# Almost all women who were rich (Passenger Class: 1) survived.
*# Poor men were the least likely to survive.
*# Passengers from Cherbourg were more likely to survive than those from other embarking locations.[[files/Feature List.png|center|thumb|Set of methods and calls used to clean up the data and retrieve the required features. We decided that features like sex and P-class were the most important, while features like fare were far less important, and hence were dropped.  ]]

* Methods found in pandas api, like fillna, and replace are used to clean up the data and retrieve the required features.

* Second Semester teams:
** Automatically Defined Functions.
** Research Fundamentals (Bloat Control).
** EzCGP.
** Natural Language Processing.

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* Good Algorithm Requirements:
** Space efficiency
** Minimize errors.
** True positive and False positive performance.
** Time efficient.
** Security.
** Precision and results.
** Usability.
** Cost Effectiveness.
** Power consumptions.
* Evaluations of a genetic algorithm:
** Evaluation involves setting and comparing scores.
*** True Positive: How often the algorithm is identifying the desired object.
*** False Positive: How often the genetic algorithm is identifying a wrong object as the desired object.
** Classification Measures:
*** Classifier uses data to predict classification of individuals in the data set. 
*** Confusion Matrix: Matrix of actual positive, actual negative and Predicted Positive (True Positive and False Positive), and Predicted Negative (True Negative and False Negative.).
** Maximization Measure:
*** Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR) :
**** TPR = TP / P = TP / (TP + FN)
*** Specificity or True Negative Rate (TNR) :
**** TNR = TN / N = TN / (TN + FP)
*** False Negative Rate (FNR) = FN / P = FN / (TP + FN)
*** Fallout or False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP / N
*** Accuracy(ACC) = (TP + TN) / (P + N) = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + FN + TN)

=== General Information ===
* Discussed how to setup VIP notebooks on the wiki.

=== Team Meeting Notes ===
* Genetic Algorithm implementation using a function as an individual.
* Terminology:
** Primitive: Nodes/Functions.
** Tree Representation: Nodes can be represented using a tree data structure diagram.
** Functional Representation: A mathematical functional representation of the node.
* Trees are converted to a lisp preorder parse tree, which is then stored.
* Weakly typed genetic program: Any input can fill in any spot.
* Strongly typed genetic algorithm: Only specific predefined types can fill in spots.
* Mating in genetic programming using tree diagrams:
** Crossover: Implemented by exchanging sub-trees. (Single point crossover)
* Mutations in Genetic Programming:
** Add/Shrink nodes.
** Change terminals.
** Change Sub-trees.
** Change the order/structure of the tree.
* Evaluating a tree: 
** Determine a set of points.
** Run f(x) for the set of points.
** Measure the error between outputs and truths.
* Primitives can also be more advanced functions, like power, or factorials, trigonometric function, etc.
* Using  more advanced primitives makes the trees more stable and simpler.
