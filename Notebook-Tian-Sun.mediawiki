==== Lecture Notes ====
* Discussing the subteam of this semester
**stock sub-subteam would attempt to formulate a paper push for publication
**work with modularity team
*Modularity subteam note:
** Modularity could take data from stocks sub-subteam within time conflict members and change the evaluation functions
** Analyzing these new datasets from stocks sub-subteam
* Directions modularity team might pursue:
   1. Using the stocks data to test on
   2. Implementing new primitives, evaluation functions directly
   3. Looking at how to store primitives in the database
   4. take several new baseline runs for both mnist and stocks data.

==== Main meeting note ====
*New team member may join
*hacktown next sarturday
*Conda issue
**no permission for installing conda
**not allowed to setup conda environment
**conda must installed inside home 
==== Personal Exploration ====
*Here is formal process of establish PACE connection:
**First use ssh tsun90@pace-ice.pace.gatech.edu establish connection with the PACE server
**After the server connection is established we now establish a job session on PACE with qsub -I -q pace-ice -l nodes=1:ppn=1,walltime=01:00:00
**move into /usr directory and run mysqldb to establish our database instance
**Now in a new terminal reconnect to the PACE and ssh into the job node we have established the formal connection with.
**Now we establish a connection with the database with command mysql
**Create a new credential with full privilege and generate a schema use CREATE DATABASE
**exit the mysql query mode and use vim modifier or nano to modify the input template of the dataset we are going to use and change database into our new database address with account name we just generated.
***NOTE: no password is needed as the account I established is not protected by one.
**After the database is configured correctly we will now try to start a run.
***load the anaconda 2020 from PACE server virtual library
***active the conda environment we have configured with all dependencies we have installed for made
**go to the directory where our emade file is and run install.py install to ensure the emade is configured in the PACE environment
**now to launch the emade run launchEMADE.py with template file we want to use.
**Encountered problem when using stock input template, it says some variable in the input template is not valid
***Stock team is using cacheV2 updated input schema
***update the input schema.xsd file resolved this issue
***another error saying the evolution function NSG2 do not exist
****There is a NSG2 function exist in our evolution functions, this bug is unclear.

==== Main meeting notes: ====
*hackathon is at this saturaday 1 P.M to 5 P.M
**All member of our team is anticipated to be presented
**Need to use new code from CacheV2 branch which will solve issue we have with PACE
==== Hachathon Secssion ====
*Continue working on the stock run this week
**Previous NSG2 error is because our team changed evolution funton name into sel_nsga2
**solved by change the name of evolution function in the input template
**successfully initialized the run without seeding at this stage.
***ERROR: Tree missing valid primitive for data type, At least one objective returned inf.
***stock team are using technical indicator as the primitive
***We must use the seeding file from the stock team to seed the database they are using.
==== Subteam meeting note ====
*Due to near midterm presentation to acquire data and table all PACE issue some of team member continue to suffer we will Temporarily switching over to google collab
**Use stock dataset, seeding files, and input templates for our run on google burning account
**Bernadette have successfully transferred all stock data files
*Midterm presentation
**Our PPT: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lus6qHH9vwdfaLxcBg50PBBOl56qF_A7wFGT4F-1hlI/edit#slide=id.g812dce5abf_2_375

==== Main Meeting Note ====
*Modularity
**perform test runs as early as better
*stock
**68% profit for the stocks
**KNN and NLP seem to be the best learners
==== subteam meeting ====
*Have 8 extended ARL runs done
**Angla and first semesters will work on Visulization of our results from runs
*cacheV2 change incorporated and we plan a test&debugg this weekend
*Using this emade-cloud folder from Xufei created with CloudCopy for testing on google collab
**https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CyOUr7xOuteQbIGf_eYu-NhfuFHA4S4W?usp=sharing
==== Personal Exploration ====
*Using the new made cloud folder created using CloudCopy script we uploaded off the new branch with all file merged for testing on google collab
**running python install.py is not working
*** Error message: docutils 0.18b0 is installed but docutils<0.18 is required
***attempt to solve by call conda install docutils=0.17
***although the installation of package is successful but the problem did not resolve, it appears the made installer will install the new version of docutils package  as a dependency for GPFramework
**attempt a workaround by ise reinstall.sh instead
***reinstall.sh is not running, it appears a line break is reader by google colla
***remove the end of line break in the file resolves this issue
***New issue here

=== Team meeting notes: ===
* Course introduction, syllabus, introduction to notebooks.
* Evolutionary and bio-inspired algorism, a massive amount of solutions will evolve with small mutations to achieve a new generation of algorism toward our objection.
* process
** individual: One candidate in a large collection of solutions
** group: a group of individual solutions
** Objective: values that need to be maximized
** Fitness: comparison between different individual
** Evaluation: process to give a score of an individual to compute fitness
** Selection: chose individuals with the highest score to produce next generation
** Crossover(Mating): produce next generation
** Mutate: result new generation will have certain differences(changes) based on their parents.
* introduction to One Max Problem

=== '''Subteam/'''Lab note: ===
'''One Max Problem'''
* Objective:  find a bit string containing all 1s with a set length
* Tools: DEAP Python library
* define the fitness objective from DEAP's base
** we define tuple for single maximize objective as (1.0)
** we define tuple for single minimize objective as (-1.0)
** we define tuple for the multi-objective problem as (1.0, 1.0)
* then use a random generator which produces either 0 or 1 to generate an individual and add into entire population which include 300 individuals
* next, we let the entire population go through genetic algorithms.
** evaluation process: map each individual into population list and assign fitness value to each of them
** then we set up evolution loops that go through 40 generations through the selection process to select an individual for crossover and cloning them to work on new instances.
** using mate and mutate functions we will mate two individuals with a 50% probability and mutates an individual with a 20% probability.
** finally printout min, max, avg, Std of each generation.
* Algorism ran for 39 generations  to achieve objection which is a max of 100
'''The N Queens Problem'''
* Objective: determine a configuration of n queens on a nxn chessboard such that no queen can be taken by one another where all queens are at the same colum

* we follow generic algorism as one max problem does however this time we define tuple to minimize
* The algorism ran for 100 generations achieved a result with a minimum at 1.0

=== Team Meeting Note ===
Genetic Programing
* In this time individual is the evaluator itself
** the individual will take data and return results of evaluation
** we can represent this algorism with trees
** during crossover subtrees are exchanged to produce a children
** mutation involves following behavior
*** change a node
*** exchange a node
*** delete/add a node
** Symbolic Regression
*** as example f(x) = sin(x)
**** primitives: +,-,*,/,variables
**** use Taylor series of sin(x) to solve this one
***** we use primitives to represent Taylor series
**** EDAME: we want the computer to do itself as much as possible
***** as an example get more possible primitives that can help achieve the objective

=== Lab Note ===

===== Symbolic Regression =====
* This lab generates a function that models out objective function the best way it can, we will utilize Genetic Programing technique to achieve this object.
** Use a binary tree to represent algorism, each node is primitive data.
** nodes will be altered at each generation Multi-Objective Genetic Programming
** the code structure is similar to previous algorism which consist evaluation, selection, mutate process
** the fitness of the function will be determined based on its output with expectation, we will calculate fitness score as mean squares error, the objective of this algorism is to minimize mean squares error.
** two primitive types added are:
*** add
*** divide
** mutation method added is
*** mutInsert
**** This funtion will insert a new primitive node make original subtree become one of the children.

=== Team Meeting Note ===
Multiple Objective 
* Objective space
** space containing set of objectives to achieve
* Classify Algorism
** some item will be classified correctly some would not
** we want an algorism to eliminate such error and achieve all corrrect result
** There are 4 objectives: all positive will classified as positive and non of them classified as negative, all negative will classified as negative and non of them classified as positive.
** Objective space: minimize false-positive and false-negative rates.
** Accuracy: (TP+TN)/Total Number
** Precision = TP/(TP+NP)
** False Discovery Rate = 1 - Precision
* Pareto Optimality
** a individual which no other individual inside the population outperforms the individual on all objectives.
* Nondominated Sorting Generic Algorism II
** a set of Pareto optimal individual would be a good solution.
* Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorism II
** Strength of Pareto is how many other points in the population it dominates
** Rank: sum of sterngre of individuals that dominates it.

'''Main Meeting'''

Group 4, 5 are present their Titanic dataset assignment.

Start with EMADE instructions, the final presentation set for March 22, 2021, we will work on EMADE from this week until March 22 presentation.

=== Sub Team Meeting at March 5, 2021 ===
* Our team meeting today to figure out what would we do for this assignment.
* We started with setting up MySql Server, We have encountered several problems,
** First, we started to ensure each member have finished the installation of EMADE and MySql.
** We then attempt to set up a MySql server and let each member connect to it, however, the first attempt hse failed.
** Through I am able to create a connection with Workbench but the system keep saying I'm not on Windows while I am, other members are unable to set up a connection at all.
** As result, after few minutes of research Justin able to set up a new server, while the majority of the team are able to connect, I'm receiving ERROR 2003(60) when an attempt to connect.
* I will continue to search for a solution while my teammates attempt to run EMADE.
* GROUP WORKS
** After connection successful, we created a new schema(database) called Titanic and several tables for EMADE
** EMADE runs and outputs 6 pareto-optimal frontier datasets and returned an error to us.
** without any luck to resolve the error after several attempts we decided to wait for Wednesday's class.
* INDIVIDUAL WORKS
** Try to find a solution to ERROR 2003
*** Find it's necessary to let network firewall allow port 3306's network ingressive.
*** FInd there is a file "my.cnf(my.bin on Windows) may have IP-binding disallow the external connection
*** fixed all those prementioned problems and switched from Workbench to Sql pro for UI interface.
*** Will tested when the remote server is started at Wednesday

==== Main Meeting ====
* a working meeting today.
* A bug for deap on newest version, it's necessary to change to version 1.2.2.
* INDIVIDUAL
** I am able to establish a connection and run EMADE as a worker process after connecting to school VPN, the reason behind this is unclear.
* GROUP
** the error encountered is not a major problem we will proceed with our paredo-optimal result.

==== Sub Team Meeting March 12, 2021 ====
* We just meet today to see if each of us are able to establish a connection and ensure after every member joined our paredo result are still good.
* We weren't able to generate a visualization of paredo fronts, we decided to wait for next Wednesday for questions.

==== Main Meeting ====
* Another work session
* Demonstrated how to visualize our results.
* Meet again this Friday to finish up visualization and create the presentation

==== Team Meeting ====
* Team meeting to finalize our result
* Take the output, use Jupiter code to generate a graph of Pareto front to visualize our data.
* Instead to take the raw result from EMADE, GP, and individual algorisms we decided to make a False-negative rate and false positive rate graph.
* Discussed the distribution of presentation and content we wish to address.
* I will be responsible to compare three methods we have used on the Titanic problem.
* Discussed why that EMADE although spend too much time and consume enormous computational resource the result is still not best.
* Individual work:
** looks into detail of each individual output.
** check results from previous semesters to see if we are a special case, it appears that EMADE generates worse results in a common situation.
** Ideas for poor EMADE result:
*** EMADE runs for only so many generations, we may be able to improve the result should the number of generations increases.
*** majority of result from EMADE is attempting to minimize false positives and each optimal individuals are better than general programing result. The poor overall result comes from the individuals on the false-negative side, EMADE may centralize to minimize false positives in early generations cause the poor general results.
** practice for midterm presentation.

==== Main Meeting ====
* I have been assigned to the Modularity group.

==== Team Meeting ====
* First team meeting as a modularity team member.
* Mainly an introduction section.
* Introduced with a modified EMADE GitHub repo to implement ARL, and collab which would be used for any future EMADE runs.
* Future work for the rest of the semester is to focus on MNIST Experiments.

* Another Team meeting on Sunday
** Addressed some error encountered by the first semester during collab run
** I attempt to run EMADE for 10 generations using colab locally.

==== Individual ====
* Set up new Github repo on my machine.
* Use the given google collab to run MINST locally.
* Start read some recommended Literature, following is a list of recommendation for ARLs:
** Discovery of Subroutines in Genetic Programming
** Towards Automatic Discovery of Building Blocks in Genetic Programming
** An Analysis of Automatic Subroutine Discovery in Genetic Programming.

==== Main Meeting ====
* Introduced with Statistical analysis
** A/B testing: make a control run, then change some variables we want to investigate and perform an experimental run to see the effect.
** Introduced standard deviation
* Hypothesis testing
** t-testing is a great way to test how far off we are from the mean value.
** p-value may be calculated from t-testing results with char.
** if p< 0.05 we have a good result.
** we can use Welch's t-test under the condition that we don't have a great deal of information.
*** This is a good test to test a hypothesis where two groups of data resulted in equal mean values.
** Note should two distributions are not equal we want to use a 2-tailed test with a higher t-statistic.
==== Team Meeting ====
* For first semesters:
** Read more literature for more understanding of the principles of ARL.
** run some baseline MNIST dataset.
** run as worker process and contribute processing power.

*NOTE: notes of work and team meeting are taken locally as the access to the wiki is not stable at this point, Edit functionality returns error 500.

==== Team Meeting ====
* We are unable to have many successful individuals for seeding and analysis.
** Our current hypothesis of the problem is:
*** the failure of individuals comes from poor objectives and poor seeds.
*** Team will work to improve results based on this hypothesis.
* First Semester student task:
** creating new objectives
** Finding better-succeded individuals
