'''General Meeting Notes:'''
* We completed the presentations!
* NLPÂ NN presentation https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z8PjzaP_LjhyycpGSeXX7rIHdVYkxHzqg8vaKVEYhdU/edit#slide=id.gaec8ee0d3b_1_3
* Finish up notebooks
** Write specific to-dos that are actually actionable tasks
** For each of these tasks you did, include pictures, code snippets, etc., to show you did the work
** Emphasize not only team work but also your individual contributions
** Someone in a later semester should be able to replicate what you did, using your notebook

* Stocks Market Analysis and Portfolio Optimization:
** Used a reserach paper in order to measure EMADE successfulness on the same (or simiilar) task
** Created new Technical Indicator Primitives in EMADE
*** Paper's technical indicators:
**** Stochastic Oscillator
**** Relative Strength Indicator
**** William's R%
**** Simple Moving Average
**** Exponential Moving Average
**** Moving Average Convergence and Divergence
**** Ease of movement
***** Distance Moved
***** Box Ratio
*** Team's primitives:
**** On-Balance Volume
***** Price is up intra-day -> add volume to OBV
***** Price is down intra-day -> subtract volume to OBV
***** Volumes over 3-14 days (cumulative)
***** The more days its tracks the better it becomes
**** Bollinger Bands
***** A movement KPI
**** Commodity Channel Indicator
***** Indicate trend prices vs average prices over time
***** Used to pinpoint areas where stocks are bought in surplus vs sold in surplus
**** Money Flow Index
***** Volume is key
*****
** Output of paper vs EMADE runs done by team
*** They believe some fluke gave them more accurate predictions
*** Paper Results (Predicted: 24.287%, Truth: 8.647%)
*** EMADE Results (Predicted: 5.053%, Truth: 12.314%)[[files/A1.png|center|thumb]][[files/A2.png|center|thumb]]
*** Next semester
**** Normalize the data and try again
**** Test larger test ranges + more granular data
**** Increase genetic labeling
* EzCGP team
** Incorporating CV primitives into runs for preprocessing
*** Filtering
*** Thresholding
*** Blurring
*** Normalize
** Instead of using F1 score + accuracy to guage performance, now using precision
** In terms of PACE issues:
** When deciding between Conda install vs Pip installing for '''<u>tensorflow</u>''', they thought pip install was better based off of their personal experience
** EzCGP team results up against the CIFAR10 dataset
*** Data split used: 60:20:20; training, validation, testing
*** Ran for 9 generations (at a rate of roughly 6 hours per generation)
**** Best individual:
***** F1 Score - 0.97
***** Precision - 0.98
***** Recall - 0.97
**** Gen 1 AUC: 0.921
**** Gen 9 AUC: 0.982
**** [[files/A3.png|center|thumb]]
** Further efforts into research within EZCGP include:
*** Blocking experiments (MNIST dataset)
**** Aiming to affect convergence of a population to competitive fitnesses
*** Aging Evolution
**** Pruning old individuals to allow them to "die"
***** Increased diversity in individuals
***** Hopeful on if it will increase results
*** Construct reference curves from previously produced curves
** Future Goals
*** Researching new mating methods
*** More blocking experiments
*** More experiments on MNIST dataset
*** "Marrying" EZCGP and EMADE
**** I'm unsure what this means. Maybe ask?
**** Dr. Zutty touched on this in his questions and clarified!
*** Continue neural architecture search experiment
* NLP NN
** Slides that I created + presented:
** [[files/C12.png|center|thumb]] [[files/C13.png|center|thumb]] [[files/C14.png|center|thumb]]
** CV team overall's slides
** [[files/D1.png|center|thumb|464x464px]]
* [[files/D2.png|center|thumb|470x470px]]
[[files/D3.png|center|thumb|482x482px]]
[[files/D4.png|center|thumb|523x523px]]
* Modularity
** Creating something called "ARLs"
** These are abstract primitives that group other primitives together as "building blocks" such that they can't be segmented apart for further generations
** They are essentially combinations of primitives into a single node as a new individual
** ARLs are selected based on frequency and distribution
** Individual broken down into possible candidates and then abstract those components into a single node which is now known as an ARL
*** Selected based on cumulative distribution from frequency and fitness
*** I had  question regarding if this is similar to "pruning" in decision trees, and asked it! Dr. Zutty and the team both clarified some concepts. Rather than pruning (which happens after the fact), this is preemptive. but similar!
** ARLs are selected based on frequency and distribution
** Titanic dataset results
*** Conducted runs on the titanic dataset
*** Planning on incorporating MNIST dataset here
*** Aimed to minimize FP & FN
*** Began seeded runs with 5 individuals, capped at 40 generations
** Team conducted numerous experiments
*** Experiment 1
**** Difference as the fitness of itself and most fit parent (good child = positive value)
**** For some reason, there is some noticable statistical significance around generations 16 to 19
**** As generations continued, this converged once again
*** Experiment 2
**** Linearly scaled selections for tournament with ARLs
**** Statistical significance around generations 11 to 19
**** As generations continued, this converged once again
*** Experiment 3
**** Worked with ARL creation using datapair fix
**** If they don't take in a data pair split (split of individuals), then it's not a valid ARL
**** Statistical significance not found
*** Experiment 4 (combination of 2 and 3)
**** Worked on to reducing bloat with added data pair restrictions
**** As an individual genearlly has only up to a couple ARLs, it doensn't experience bloat of its own
**** Bad results that could have been due to small sample size
*** MNIST dataset experiments (to see how ARLs perform on a non-trivial dataset, unlike Titanic)
**** In comparison to Titanic, it was much slower
**** Ran for 49 generations
**** Really good results acheived
**** These shoudl be taken with a grain of salt as it could be a result of overfitting
** Planning on:
*** Combining efforts with ARLs (Adaptive Representation through Learning) and ADFs (Automatically Defined Functions)
*** Aim to allow ARLs to evolve as well, by adding more complexity to the creation process
'''Final Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* We discussed our future lines of work!
* This is my third and final semester of VIP and thus I had to leave behind my future correspondence and let everyone who is continuing know what work needed to be done to further the efforts I made with new primitives this semester
* In regards to all three of the new primitives created, unit testing and corroborations of usefulness must be done before the primitives are put into full use! The later is also super important because there are inputs that need to be tweaked and tried by EMADE and this is time consuming so these primitives must only be put into production if there is some use found for them and they are actually improving the CV task.
''''''My Action Items + Progress:''''''

'''Friday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* All of our runs are completed and results gathered
* Simply focusing on the delivery of the information now, and showing to the class our progress this semester
* We did a dry run through the presentation and made sure everyone was comfortable with the slides that they were doing
* I'm finishing up the coding of the primitives and now am just working on delivery of the information regarding my work this semester

''''''My Action Items + Progress:''''''

After sending the proposal document to Dr. Zutty, I received some clarification on the three questions on the proposal document

(1) These 3 primitives are new to EMADE, correct? Any thoughts on them?

Yes! Except Otsu's binarization which is in some capacity in spatial methods.

Action taken: we will implement 2d Otsu's, whichÂ applies the same method as the 1D implementation but at a local level instead of global. Basically the combination of Otsu and adaptive 

thresholding.

(2) This primitive has some extra input params that need to be set. How would this work with emade? For example, âblock sizeâ, which decides the size of the neighbourhood area. Do we just set some default value or does EMADE have the capability to test various neighborhood values.

We can always expose parameters to your helper functions when you register the primitive. EMADE will then be able to mutate or crossover the values.

(3) These go in spatial methods, right?

Yes

I began coding the primitives from here. Tusheet was able to take on coding Otsu's Binarization, and I coded Adaptive Mean Thresholding and Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding.

I pushed the code to the nlp-vip branch in spatial methods.

Jon also added all 3 primitives to the documentation!

[[files/C11.png|center|thumb]]

Finally, I worked on completing my presentation slides regarding all of our progress this semester and the new CV primitives that I headed making.

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z8PjzaP_LjhyycpGSeXX7rIHdVYkxHzqg8vaKVEYhdU/edit#slide=id.gaecbff40f4_1_1

[[files/C12.png|center|thumb]]
[[files/C13.png|center|thumb]]
[[files/C14.png|center|thumb]]

I also wrote and rehearsed a script for what I would say for the final rpesentation:

[[files/C15.png|center|thumb|741x741px]]

Finally, the last couple steps before wrapping up this semester would be:

(1) Confirming whether I have exposing parameters to EMADE correctly when making my primitivies (emailed Zutty)

(2) Completed notebook

(3) Make sure I passed on all information needed to Jon and rest of the team, so that my efforts could continue next semester (beginning with unit testing)

''''''My Action Items + Progress:''''''

Progress on the documentation is progressing! Jon has been working dilligently on taking my notes as well as his and merging everything into the notion documentation page.

Progress on '''signal methods''' documentation
[[files/Cv6.png|center|thumb|578x578px]]

Progress on '''spatial methods''' documentation
[[files/Cv7.png|center|thumb|575x575px]]

I have also narrowed down the list created last week for new potential primitive ideas:
** '''Adaptive thresholding [not in EMADE]'''
** Altering colorspaces [not in EMADE]
** Image processing: Cropping [unsure]
** Maximum thresholding [unsure]
** Hysteresis [unsure]
** Hough circle or line transforms [not in EMADE]
** Edge detection [exists]

I'll be starting my new primitive efforts with some adaptive thresholding primitives. These will most likely be added to the spatial methods file.

Adaptive thresholding is really good for scanned documents and other non-uniform lighting conditions, and therefore could come in handy for various image datasets where weâre looking to apply EMADE. For example, this is shown in the images below. On the left is the newspaper scan before adaptive thresholding, and the one on the right is after adapative thresholding is applied.
[[files/Cv8.png|center|thumb]]

'''Primitive #1: Adaptive Mean Thresholding'''

cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C : threshold value is the mean of neighbourhood area.

All the thresholding methods currently in spatial_methods.py apply thresholds as global values across the entire input image. This is not as effective in conditions where the image has different lighting conditions in different areas. In this case, adaptive thresholding yields really good results. The algorithm in an adaptive thresholding primitive calculates the threshold for small regions of the image, separately, and gives better results for images of varying illumination.

[[files/Cv10.png|center|thumb]]
[[files/C1.png|center|thumb]]
'''Primitive #2: Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding'''

cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C : threshold value is the weighted sum of neighbourhood values where weights are a gaussian window.

As mentioned above, adaptive thresholding is really good for scanned documents and other non-uniform lighting conditions, and therefore could come in handy for various image datasets where weâre looking to apply EMADE.
[[files/Cv10.png|center|thumb]]
[[files/C5.png|center|thumb]]

'''Primitive #3: 2D Otsuâs Binarization'''

cv2.THRESH_OTSU: algorithm finds the optimal threshold value

This form of thresholding is much more effective than (it seems) the thresholding methods that are currently in spatial_methods.py and this is because it appears that those thresholding methods are running with a default threshold value. Iâm curious if EMADE does any tweaking to that value at all in order to optimize it when itâs applied to images. But if not, I believe Otsuâs binarization thresholding could come very handy for our purposes in the EMADE framework.

In global thresholding, we used an arbitrary value for threshold value and use trial and error to understand if what we selected was a good threshold value or not. But consider a bimodal image (where intensity histogram has two peaks â similar to our scan dataset of chest xrays). For that image, we can approximately take a value in the middle of those peaks as threshold value, which is what Otsu binarization calculates on its own (that ideal threshold). This works really well for images that are bimodal, and thus should give great results over all other thresholding methods for our chest xray dataset which is greyscale, as it can help emphasize the affected âwhiteâ areas that are key for classification of certain disease labels.

1D Otsu's appears to already be in some form in spatial_methods.py

The primitive that I am planning on adding is Otsu's 2D implementation. This applies the same method as the 1D implementation but at a local level instead of global. Basically the combination of Otsu and adaptive thresholding.

'''<u>Proposal document</u>'''

Now that I have narrowed down my new primitive ideas, I composed the proposal - along with the questions that I needed to make sure were addressed before beginning implementation - into a document. I need to address the following questions:

(1) These 3 primitives are new to EMADE, correct? Any thoughts on them?

(2) This primitive has some extra input params that need to be set. How would this work with emade? For example, âblock sizeâ, which decides the size of the neighbourhood area. Do we just set some default value or does EMADE have the capability to test various neighborhood values.

(3) These go in spatial methods, right?

[[files/C9.png|center|thumb|722x722px]]

The final step before implementation is to now run everything by Dr. Zutty!

''''''My Action Items + Progress:''''''

By now, I had completed all of the background research that I needed in order to get caught up to speed with signal processing, image processing, masks, filters, and image math. I also had a decent grasp over the primitives for edge detection and thresholding, etc, that EMADE already incorporated.

The next step was to observe any gaps that may exist in EMADE and see how I can fill those gaps with any new primitive ideas.

This would have to be done in the following steps:

(1) Look into various OpenCV methods that could be applied in spatial methods with an EMADE shell

(2) Look into primitives that are useful for the scanned images and varying lighting conditions that are present in the chest xray dataset

(3) Look into vital CV concepts and then backtrack and see if they are implemented in existing EMADE CV primitives

** https://stackabuse.com/introduction-to-image-processing-in-python-with-opencv/
** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAp0ZhYvW6XbEveYeefGSuLhaPlFML9gP
* New primitive ideas to pursue
** Adaptive thresholding [not in EMADE]
** Altering colorspaces [not in EMADE]
** Image processing: Cropping [unsure]
** Maximum thresholding [unsure]
** Hysteresis [unsure]
** Hough circle or line transforms [not in EMADE]
** Edge detection [exists]

I decided to start a brainstorming document where I put all of these ideas and developed the best ones that I thought would be most impactful for me to go ahead and implement, especially in terms of the chest xray dataset.
[[files/Cv1.png|center|thumb]]

I also worked with Jon to begin the documentation efforts. I sent over all of my documentation thus far (from the past week) where I recorded the different aspects of the signal and spatial files in EMADE, as well as some notes about resources for learning about them. As Jon is coming in with not as much knowledge about the area, he felt more comfortable taking the documentation task and running with that, as he gets familiar with the CV space. He is beginnign a notion documentation page that should detail a lot more (for any more beginners to come) what all is contained inside of these 3 files for CV primitives in EMADE.
[[files/Cv5.png|center|thumb|352x352px]]

Jon will be taking point on this task of documentation!

** After discussions it seemed to outline a similar yet definitely different thought process when compared to the concept of dropout regularization''''''My Action Items + Progress:''''''

I took a lot of time this week to learn up about the methods in these files. This is the foundation for the new primitives effort, because I do not know a single thing about any of the primitives in the files already (how they work, what they're used for, why they are used, etc) and therefore can't even start brainstorming new primitives until this groundwork is completed.

'''<u>Signal Methods</u>'''

https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/blob/nlp-nn/src/GPFramework/signal_methods.py

<u>Window Functions:</u>

AÂ window functionÂ performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.

Signal processing typically uses a Fourier Transform to convert data captured in the time domain to the frequency domain. If a signal is captured in a periodic manner, the resulting signal has no leakage and requires no windowing (left). However, if the signal is captured in an aperiodic manner, there will be leakage and a window function is necessary (right).

Wikipedia: In signal processing and statistics, aÂ window functionÂ (also known as an apodizationÂ functionÂ or taperingÂ function) is a mathematicalÂ functionÂ that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval, normally symmetric around the middle of the interval, usually near a maximum in the middle, and usually tapering away from center.

Professor Zutty confirmed that this file will not be of much use for my purposes.

'''I completed learning about the CV primitives in EMADE this week! I believe I understand enough about the various primitives in emade as well as how computer vision tasks work on pixels in image data. With this knowledge, I think I can start looking at the Chest XRay dataset novelties and how I may come up with ideas for improving performance on it. This is what I will be doing from next week onward.'''

** (5) Getting some ideas for primitives that would be good additions
** (6) Confirming that I'm not missing anything with Zutty (getting approval)
** (7) Coding the primitives

*** This will most likely have to be pushed till next semester, because I have quite a bit of work cut out for me as it is, especially with the amount of learning I'll have to do in order to onboard myself into CV primitives and how they work, and what is important to note about them
I began this week by scoping out the three files that were mentioend to me and just looking into how EMADE combined primitives for CV tasks. I asked some questions regarding this in our weekly update meetings with professor Zutty and he also explained how this works! The primitives for CV are also stacked and therefore take in an input shape, apply some transformations to the input, and then extrude an output shape that is the same sa what went in so that all primitives can be stacked together in any order desired.

** Good idea to go ahead with the new primitives work
** I will be taking point on those efforts, and it'll be my responsibility to drive that work forward from here on out
** Zutty reinforced that I should look into the following files and confirmed I had been doing work in the right place: spatial_methods.py, signal_methods.py, and feature_extraction_methods.py
'''Friday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* Distributed tasks for the CV team on how to implement these new ideas

''''''My Action Items + Progress:''''''

I was in charge of adding my ideas of future work to the slides:

(1) Completing the runs on the chest xray dataset and evaluating performance

(2) Incorporating another dataset (really good new member job!)

(3) Delving deep into the CV primitives that are in EMADE and exploring how they may be improved

(4) Utilizing EMADE chest xray performance to see how certain examples may be misclassified, and observing if there are any novelties in these examples for which we can introduce new primitives that may be better for those tasks

I decided to branch off from the rest of the CV team who are doing the chest xray runs and go forward with leading the efforts to develop new primitives in EMADE for the CV task!

I was responsible for conveying the information regarding this new effort that was going to be taking place on the CV subteam!

This was my idea and I therefore completed all of the background research necessary before launching into creating my pitch in the midterm presentation slides regarding future work and opportunity for new students.

This is also an area that I have been super interested in, so it will really help me grow my personal knowledge in the area while contributing to EMADE and our CV task (specifically, chest xray dataset).

I did extensive research into the three files that I had been pointed towards spatial_methods.py, signal_methods.py, and feature_extraction_methods.py

And made these slides in the midterm presentation on my own, to go along with my pitch and progress thus far:
[[files/Sc1.png|center|thumb|489x489px|sc1]]
[[files/Sc2.png|center|thumb|489x489px|sc2]]

In addition to this, I wrote my speech out that I would be saying during the midterm presentation and practiced it extensively to make sure I was going to be delivering the information in an effective manner that coupled the graphics on the screen.
[[files/Sc3.png|center|thumb|508x508px|sc3]]
[[files/Sc4.png|center|thumb|582x582px|sc4]]

I took on these slides to speak on which is work that I have and plan to continue working on for the rest of the semester. I pitched it to others on the CV team as well as new arrivals, for anyone who wanted to join my efforts!

'''General Meeting Notes:'''
* Midterm Presentation is on Monday 19th October 2020 @5pm
'''Monday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* Stocks
** Did some baseline runs (I believe) and calculated standard error of their models
** Todo: explore paper's results and how they were calculating different metrics
* EzCGP
** Research Team
*** Presentation
*** Research paper work and summaries on those
** Implementation Team
*** Baseline runs and analyzing the results
* NLP
** Working on adaptive mutation, attention, shuffle layers
** Could be space within NLP NN to write a paper? Discussed with Dr. Zutty
** For this we require an industry novelty, or really good results on something preexisting - requires further review! Would be fun!
* Modularity
** My internet cut out and I couldn't catch most of this team's update
'''Friday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* Resolved the MySQL database error + anaconda errors we were facing, as a team
* Fixed up my colab environment and it is now ready to perform runs (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bhRodLmoobRtAJFtrKLkGtR__wlHbB1Q)
** EMADE
** Dependencies
** Anaconda environment
** Port forwarding
* This week, I did a lot of work with Anish to discuss how to move forward in terms of CV primitives, and what had already been done in EMADE in that space
** He mentioned three different files that I could look into: spatial_methods.py, signal_methods.py, and feature_extraction_methods.py
** I will be prioritizing looking into these further, next week
* This week, I am prioritizing ideating and preparing how to pitch out project in the midterm presentation
''''''My Action Items + Progress:''''''

I created a task plan for divvying up our future work within the CV team. We have quite a few members on this (sub) subteam and I was just doing some brainstorming this week on how we could move forward most effectively. This will also come in really handy for when we get new members as well, so we can pitch out project as best as possible in the midterm presentations.

(1) Completing the runs on the chest xray dataset and evaluating performance

(2) Incorporating another dataset (really good new member job!)

(3) Delving deep into the CV primitives that are in EMADE and exploring how they may be improved

(4) Utilizing EMADE chest xray performance to see how certain examples may be misclassified, and observing if there are any novelties in these examples for which we can introduce new primitives that may be better for those tasks

I added this information to our midterm presentation slides later on!!

I resolved all of my Google Colab issues and became ready to perform runs this week! I also was working with the team on some common issues with the port forwarding.

* Stocks
** Working on technical indicators (overarching goal) but got done adding some SciKit regression functions
** NN work with Keras being done
* EzCGP
** New documentations on augmentor pipeline architecture (I have no idea what this means, but would love to learn more!)
** Research Team:

** Implementation Team
*** Adding new primitives
*** Loading CIFAR-10 dataset
* NLP NN
** Pulak and his side of NLP NN working on two approaches for invalidating individuals (aborting them before evaluation and genomic healing (changing representation of fatal instances instead of removing)
** CV team working thru PACE issues (exploring Colab as an alternative)
** I suggested more word embeddings that are better - is a line of work that they are exploring on Pulak's side of NLP NN (not CV subteam)
** Also doing some work with shufflign mutation function layers
* Modularity
** Looking into MNIST Dataset
** New ARLs evaluation seems that they are more useful btu this is on Titanic, so looking into more complex dataset perhaps?
'''Friday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''

** EMADE
** Dependencies
** Anaconda environment
** Port forwarding
* I was not experiencing the same MySQL issues on Colab as Tusheet seemed to be having, at first (linking colab and database)
** We discussed what may have been causing this (as we all experienced something similar last semester)
* I was however running into some minor conda problems with imports and the colab file itself
** Communicated these to the team and worked with Anuraag and Tusheet to solve the issues
* Ppaer discussed in meeting this week: Adaptive Mutation in Genetic Algorithms by Libelli & Alba
** https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s005000000042

*** Interesting paper!! excited to talk about this with the group
** Paper 2:Â https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2020/08/06/neural-architecture-search.html
*** I don't think this paper is really applicable to us (as far as my knowledge goes with EMADE... I could totally be wrong, so curious on what others will say)
** Paper 3:Â https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12056
*** Their setup looks much different than ours, not sure how this will transfer over
''''''My Action Items + Progress:''''''

Notebook completed thus far, in time for midterm evals.

I finished setup of my Google Collab environment this week. Running into some minor conda problems but I'm sure I can work with Anuraag and Tusheet to get these situated, because they aren't running into the same issues as I am. Plan to sort this out with them soon

''''''My Action Items + Progress:''''''

I finished facilitating the transition to Google Colab for all of our runs. Everything was set up and ready to go, so we could now pivot from using PACE and hopefully get a move on with our preliminary runs https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CTgRr52mTcykxolHUGWYODvbC8gGCZ6N#scrollTo=nKFsz9GLJP-K

Now we are beginning our efforts with port forwarding.

I finished up reading the new paper we were discussing this week: [[files/MarsiliLibelli-Alba2000 Article AdaptiveMutationInGeneticAlgor.pdf]]

I'm wasn't sure where I stood on it, so i don't have many personal notes, but I was interested in others' take and opinions in the meeting

Midterm peer evaluations due soon + I completed mine.

'''General Meeting Notes:'''
* N/A
'''Monday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* Stocks
** Planning on modeling their own study after the research papers they read (chose one out of many researched)
** Use ADD to see if the EMADE architecture can be applied to this problem such that it received novel results and outperforms the paper
** Planning on using AWS with Google Collab
*** Ask why they aren't just using GCP? Curious.
* Modularity
** They were running into quite a few hurdles
** "Cannot connect to database during query" MySQL error --> similar to one NLP was experiencing (including me)
** We also couldn't figure it out
** The team plans on working with us (NN) to try and fix up common inssues we're having in a more efficient manner
** Also having colab issues when hooking with MySQL database (going to try connecting to local IP address)
* EzCGP
** Currently looking for more research papers and discussing new ideas
** Working on unit testing new EzCGP features that have been worked on thus far
** Will be loading cifar-10 dataset into EMADE for testing purposes
** Discussed more ideas from additional research papers discovered
* NLP
** Updates from CV subteam:
*** Setting up PACE for EMADE runs basically finished (hopefully)
** Updates on paper reviewed last week [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s005000000042<nowiki>] are that it doesn't really align with our goals, and won't be of much use for us</nowiki>
** Working on (1) Word embeddings and (2) Adaptive mutations
** Results with activation functions and pretrained embeddings mutation functions:
*** Best individual after 100 generations: 0.03555 score, individual: NNLearner(ARG0, OutputLayer(ARG0, GRULayer(55, sigmoidActivation, 10, falseBool, trueBool, EmbeddingLayer(94, ARG0, gloveTwitterWeights, InputLayer(ARG0)))), 100)
*** Best individual after 70 generations: 0.03558 score, individual:NNLearner(ARG0, OutputLayer(ARG0, GRULayer(93, defaultActivation, 150, falseBool, falseBool, EmbeddingLayer(1, ARG0, gloveTwitterWeights, InputLayer(ARG0)))), 95)
*** The validation accuracy remained the same: 0.04027.
*** Focusing on enabling crossover across various layers
'''Friday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* CV team working on completing PACE hookup as new issues have arrised with the conda environment
** ERROR: exceeded disk quota
** SOLN: Deleting extra datasets, .git files (large portion), and uneeded input datasets from EMADE PACE folder
** ERROR: conda errors with linking with PACE
** SOLN: re-loaded anaconda and re-created conda environment
* Discussed moving completely to Google Colab instead of PACE in order to complete our runs
* This may allow us to have less issues like the ones we've been facing since last semester with PACE
* Tusheet and I decided to start working on getting Collab set up, based on some initial work by Anish
** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CTgRr52mTcykxolHUGWYODvbC8gGCZ6N#scrollTo=nKFsz9GLJP-K
* Entire team: reading https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220117106_A_Genetic_Algorithm_with_Adaptive_Mutations_and_Family_Competition_for_Training_Neural_Networks
** My notes to present next meeting to the team (after reading):
*** Paper's adaptive mutations not effective (really slow) due to the immense amount of calculations in each iteration of the method

'''My Action Items + Progress:'''

I worked on the setup with Google Collab on my machine, to test out if this would be a better alternative to PACE (while most of the rest of the group continued on PACE, in the meantime, in case it turned out that would be our best option).

Worked with Tusheet to learn about transfer learning a bit more. Consulted the rest of the team on what their thoughts were as well, and how we would take this forward.

Repo resource: https://github.com/vinaya8/Transfer-Learning-on-Chest-X-Ray-Images

Tusheet may continue on with the transfer learning task while I continue work on the Collab issues we are having, to get a solid foundation for runs.

I've also been working on the Google Collab setup process with the team: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CTgRr52mTcykxolHUGWYODvbC8gGCZ6N#scrollTo=nKFsz9GLJP-K

* NLP NN branch should be set up with PACE for our task

* Tusheet updated us on his MySQL errors that he was having
* As I was a tad behind the group in getting everything set up for the run, I hadn't tried it out yet and when I did I realized that I was having similar issues
* MySQL seemed to be having issues due to the mycnf changes that I had made in regards to the path variables changing
* After this MySQL issue is ironed out once and for all, I plan on beginning the preliminary test on the Chest X-Ray dataset
* I also managed to look into the transfer learning concept again, and will be on the lookout for github repositories that contain pretrained models with which we can seed our model

'''General Meeting Notes:'''
* Discussed team updates
* Our structure for providing updates is that what we work on in the CV group will be relayed by Anuraag to Pulak, who will then bring up pain points and progress updates in Monday meetings
* Stocks subteam was created and divided into three areas:
** ML in trading
** EMADE integration with Pre-Developed indicators
** Developing original technical indicators in EMADE (put on hold until group is more grounded)
* EzCGP divided into two subgroups:
** Group that works on maintaining the current repository and improving the work that has been done so far
** Group for researching and creating new features to incorporate into EzCGP
* NLP:
** Google Colab with EMADE setup for short runs and tests
** Running EMADE on toxicity datasets to observe all features that come out in the pareto front and those that don't
** Adding in more hyperparameters for the evolution to manipulate
** Looking into new functions that can be added into the evolutionary process
** Potential for adding new word embeddings (ELMO, BERT, GPT2/3)
** [CV] Exploring chest x-ray dataset and establishing a baseline run for this semester in order to be able to compare performance later in the semester
** [CV] Define the functions that are already a part of EMADE for CV tasks
** [CV] Definte the functions that must be added for CV tasks
'''Monday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* The instructions for setting up PACE to run with EMADE are not exactly working the way that they are currently
* These issues were faced by everyone on the team
* Edits must be made to the mycnf file in order to resolve issues in the path
'''Friday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* I worked with the team in order to complete the changes that needed to be made to mycnf file
* Updated the team on the fact that I was successful in launching PACE and being able to run some preliminary tests
* We discussed that our Friday meetings would generally be to update our subgroups (ie. updating the CV group) on our progress, as well as holding sessions with the entire NLP subteam in order to share important ML papers and github repos that we researched and found that may be able to inspire us into adding certain functionalities and features into EMADE in order to improve the performance of EMADE for our task

== ''' August 24th, 2020 [Week 32]''' ==

'''General Meeting Notes:'''
* We confirmed our subteams
* I confirmed my choice to be a part of the NLP subteam again this year, specifically working on the CV division of the team
* I will be working on a smaller team within NLP along with Tusheet, Anuraag, Vietfu, and Sanket
* Other teams:
** Stocks
** EzCGP
** Bloat
** Modularity (AFD)
'''Monday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* We hopped on a call directly after the general meeting + updates in order to discuss our meeting times and to get on the same page for what to work on this week
* Documented meeting minutes:
** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jrezh0mv2DKAzgtlhbHza7O9h7FKutCCPlP5enfTmP4/edit?usp=sharing
** Additions/suggestions that I made, so we can improve upon work done over the summer: [[files/Screen Shot 2020-09-21 at 2.42.11 PM.png|thumb|Pictured in blue: additions that I made to the document and discussed with the team|none|543x543px]]
*Anish shared with us a Google Colab file so that we could help in the process of connecting EMADE up with Google Colab
**files/ https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Hn-nMMNj3R922A_HFelQJwShatdfeONl?usp=sharing
**This Google Colab link would be used in order to try out short runs
**Notes:
***Google Colab is a Jupyter Notebook that is hosted on a Google VM instance
***This allows us to work on a VM with pretty good GPU/TPU, CPU, and RAM specs for free
***It doesn't last however (recycles after ~90 minutes with a closed tab and ~ 18 hours with an open tab)
***Good for testing things and small runs (especially if GPU is needed)
*Each subteam within NLP gave their updates on what their pain points were as well as progress that had been made from the previous meeting
*We officially made the CV subteam after the go ahead from Dr. Zutty
*Anuraag, Tusheet and I from the CV team shared our common issue of having log in issues with PACE
**We all worked together with Pulak in order to resolve these by the end of the meeting
'''Friday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* We decided that Anuraag would be in the best position to head the CV team and relay information between team members and Pulak (+ the rest of the NLP team), so that Pulak would be able to add the CV team updates in with the rest of the NLP team updates when updating Dr. Zutty and other teams
* The CV team discussed our to-dos:
** We decided that we would be using PACE for training and EMADE runs (rather than Colab because Colab recycles often and therefore we would have to repeatedly run our trials
** We identified that Anshul had done looking into the CV applications on EMADE, and made note that we would ask him questions as they arose
** Logging into PACE and ensuring environment setup
** Training EMADE on chest x-ray dataset
** Noted that we could potentially make use of Transfer Learning
** All of these updates were to be shared with Dr. Zutty at our next meeting (Anuragg would relay them to Pulak prior to the Monday meeting)
*The experienced members worked together to introduce the document created last semester for PACE setup and installations, so that newer members could be caught up to speed with all of the installation and prep work needed in order to run EMADE on PACE
**https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VIv4EM1KhaUToZpEhKNx3lQs-Hu7QSOk4VEqZcx2tIs/edit?usp=sharing
*Re-review the paper (to really get a soid grip on it)
*Go through both Cifar 10 dataset as well as Chest X-Ray dataset

== ''' August 17th, 2020 [Week 31]''' ==

'''General Meeting Notes:'''
* This was our first meeting of the semester!
* We discussed course details and goals
* There was a general rundown of the various subteams that we could choose to be a part of
** Three that stood out to me:
*** CV subteam
*** Stocks subteam
*** NLP subteam (I have been on this team for 2 semesters)
'''Monday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* This meeting took place directly after the general class meeting
* We discussed subteam formation, particularly the details of potentially having a CV team within NLP
* I requested that the progress that occured within NLP over the summer be reviewed with the entire team, so that we could be caught up to speed
* While Anish was giving the overview, I made some suggestions for areas where we can improve the NLP codebase and do some work this semester
* Documented meeting minutes:
** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jrezh0mv2DKAzgtlhbHza7O9h7FKutCCPlP5enfTmP4/edit?usp=sharing
** Additions/suggestions that I made, so we can improve upon work done over the summer: [[files/Screen Shot 2020-09-21 at 2.42.11 PM.png|thumb|Pictured in blue: additions that I made to the document and discussed with the team|none|543x543px]]
*By the end of this meeting, we decided that CV could essentially be a part of the NLP team
* Subteam formation/selection process:
** I decided that I would be a part of the CV team
** I will be working most closely this semester with the rest of the CV team within NLP: Tusheet, Anuraag, Vietfu, Sanket
'''Friday Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* Once this CV subteam is officially a subteam within NLP, after discussion with Dr. Zutty, we should see who will head the NLP team in general, and then also if it is necessary to assign a head of the CV team so that Pulak (coordinating NLP tasks) doesn't have to keep track of general NLP as well as CV
* Decided tasks that NLP (+ CV) will be working on this semester:
** Get Collab working for NN branch
** NN team:
*** Elmo
*** Bert
*** GPT2 and/or GPT3
**Evolution team:
***Add more functions for mutation
***Add more functions for mating
***Concatenate layers
**CV team:
***Two datasets we could use to figure out a good benchmark dataset (The paper used Chest X Ray dataset):
****Paper: https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/
****NIH chest xrays
****Cifar 10 / Cifar 100
***Goals: settle on a good benchmark dataset, and get that dataset integrated into EMADE

* Automatically Defined Functions (ADF's) [observing how ADFs can be used to improve upon the evolutionary process]
** Primitive Analysis
*** Try to find the most important and useful aspects of any particular individual
** ADF Selection
*** Tournament method created which selects individuals with more ADFs
** Differential fitness
*** How an individual has evolved since the time of its parents
* Research Fundamentals
** With the use of heuristics, neat-GP aims to control bloat intelligently
** Because it is an intelligent mechanism, and not explicit, it provides an advantage over other bloat-control techniques
** Crossover
*** Commonality between two individuals
** Speciation
*** Assigned based on shared tree structures
** Distance metric may have to be revised as tree structure is not as conductive to this sort of measurement

* NLP

'''My Slides Made:'''

'''Statistical Analysis:'''

Once the statistical analysis functions were ran on the data we obtained from the EMADE runs, we were able to see how my primitive and Tusheets primitive held upin comparison to different combinations of primitivies applied

We are able to analyze these results and see if the inclusion of any particular primitive actually increases the accuracy of the text summarization, or not

Below is an image which shows the calcualtions of false positive, false negative, true positive, and true negative values for each of the primitives
[[files/Stats1.png|center|thumb|593x593px]]
[[files/Stats2.png|center|thumb|599x599px]]
[[files/Stats3.png|center|thumb|605x605px]]

As seen in these graphs above, NumNamedEntities was less volatile and more precise (if you look at the graph incrementation), and had a slight decrease in performance over time. However, TFISF had less generations (10 compared to 24), but overall had both a better and a relatively steadily improving accuracy.

'''Future Steps:'''
* The TFISF took a longer time, even with optimization, when compared to the NumNamedEntities
* For this reason, in the future semester(s) we are looking to definitely optimize this primitive
* Add more detail to documentation to list all the changes needed when adding a new primitive
* Use an external MySQL implementation to reduce database issues
* Have more time to do analysis/run tests on how our individuals performed
'''Personal Completed Tasks This Semester:'''
* Completed the run of my primitive, which resulted in master.out, worker.out and pareto data
* Ideated various statistical analysis that could potentially be done for the final presentation
* runEMADE.pbs script created in order to queue up the job of creating individuals using the primitive
* MySQL working perfectly
** root and password setup completed
** setup unique port number
* Update input_summaries file with server port number and password information
* Changes to EMADE.py & GP_Framework_Helper.py made in order to properly provide initialization information to EMADE

* PBS script updated for MySQL
* `.my.cnf` written for MySQL
* Documentation for PACE created [in process of updating, with new changes to PACE that were made]
* Unit test for tfisf primitive written
* PBS script written in order to run unit test primitive on PACE
* Primitive ran on PACE (showing that the PACE installations thus far (w/ the exception of MYSQL) were successful)
* Changes made to primitive as needed, based on run [n/a]
** The run was successful and therefore, I concluded that no edits were needed to be made with the tfisf primitive itself
* Completed presentation slides
** Presentation Link - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pHF3fIhblYOS1TLtuORmHh5DDBoqpQEuYQdHitaXcfo/edit#slide=id.p

== ''' April 17th, 2020 [Week 30]''' ==

'''Lecture Meeting Notes:'''
* Prepared for final presentation
** BlueJeans meeting with Dr. Rohling set for Sunday to review final presentation [5-6pm]
** Discussed our plans for the statistical analysis, as well as our personal progress and how we aim to push through until the presentation with obtaining results
* Discussed putting the guide to EMADE on PACE on the VIP Team Wiki
** [[Guide to Using PACE|https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/Guide_to_Using_PACE]]
* Discussed the google doc that Alex started with all of the templates and instructions created regarding EMADE setup on PACE
* The document includes general setup information, from the point of even ssh-ing into PACE
* It contains information regarding configuring and starting the MySQL servers and ssh'ing into a node
* It also includes templates for two different PBS scripts that we found extremely useful: one to queue up a job onto PACE and the other to launch an instance of the MySQL server.
*Template made for `.my.cnf`:[[files/Cnfpic.png|center|thumb|366x366px]]

* Instructions for MySQL port setup:[[files/Portnum.png|center|thumb|472x472px]]

'''Discussed Goal:'''
* Currently working towards accomplishing the '''<u>''third''</u>''' goal on this list:
** (1) Submit a job on PACE without it crashing immediately
** (2) Submit the script to run the MySQL server
** (3) Submit the script to run the unit test on PACE
** (4) Run for individuals with my primitive on PACE to get data for statistical tests
'''Process log for PACE issues:'''
* Up until this point, all of the necessary edits should have been made such that I could easily just add my job onto the queue and run on my port of the MySQL server
* However, even with all of these changes, I was still encountering this error from earlier:
[[files/Errorfile1.png|center|thumb|682x682px]]
* We decided to have another team meeting, so Alex, Anuraag, Tusheet, and I got together via bluejeans to discuss our problems once again and work through this final stretch of errors.
* Upon a little bit of back and forth with them, it seemed that everyone was extremely puzzled with this error and had never experienced anything like it.
* After a couple hours of trying a wide range of things, I decided that perhaps I could just email Jason and he could pinpoint what none of us had been able to see.[[files/Emailpic2.png|center|thumb|784x784px]]

* After a little bit of back and forth and some explanation, he was able to pinpoint my error which was an incorrect path in the PBS script.
* After making this edit, the job submitted perfectly and even after waiting half an hour to view any errors, everything seemed to be running fine!
* From here, all I had to do was continue waiting for the job to complete, and then send the resultant data from my primitive TFISF on to Zack, who would be focusing on the statistical analysis portion, with some input from us
'''Personal Completed Tasks Thus Far:'''

<u>''[NEW]''</u>
* MySQL working perfectly
** root and password setup completed
** setup unique port number
* Update input_summaries file with server port number and password information

== ''' April 10th, 2020 [Week 29]''' ==

'''Lecture Meeting Notes:'''
* Updated Zutty and rest of the team (who weren't able to make it to the separate work meeting) on my progress with our errors
* Planned out what calculations and statistical analysis would need to be done in time for the final presentation
* The goal of this analysis is to show whether or not our primitives have or have not aided in getting more accurate summary results
'''Discussed Goal:'''
* Currently working towards accomplishing the '''<u>''second''</u>''' goal on this list, after which the rest should come quite easily:
** (1) Submit a job on PACE without it crashing immediately
** (2) Submit the script to run the MySQL server
** (3) Submit the script to run the unit test on PACE
** (4) Run for individuals with my primitive on PACE to get data for statistical tests
'''Process log for PACE issues:'''
*By this point, although I had not finished solving this error, Alex made some headway on other issues that were further down the line which we should also edit in our PACE environments, so then these changes were what I decided to work on for this past week (along with solving my error)
[[files/SLACK4.png|center|thumb|598x598px]]
* <nowiki>I began by editing `EMADE.py` at the line ~~~~ (_inst.datasetDict[dataset]['type'] == 'summarydata') ~~~</nowiki>
** This line in the file lets us define what's necessary for the individual to even be attempted, in this case the existence of both LearnerMod and TFISF
** I changed this line with information specific to my primitive:[[files/SLACK5.png|center|thumb|767x767px]]

* I also needed to edit the `gp_framework_helper.py` file and add my primitive so that it can actually be used
** This is something we should always do when creating primitives but depending on our setup may not have been done
** <nowiki>A line should be added ~~~~pset.addPrimitive(___)~~~~ with our primitive and information</nowiki>
* Then before continuing, I reinstalled before running again, and cleared my database in between each run
*Running on the same SQL port at the same time
**We then realized that another source of our problems with everything crashing repeatedly was that multiple people cannot run SQL at the same time, while on the same port
**To resolve this, a line had to be added to the `.my.cnf` file with each team member's uniquely chosen port number
**Then the template xml file had to be updated accordingly (in our case, input_summaries) with the new port information [my port number is 3315] [[files/SLACK7.png|center|thumb]]
* Finally, I had to edit some MySQL root configurations because I kept getting permission denied errors when trying to enter the MySQL server
[[files/SLACK6.png|center|thumb|716x716px]]
* The problem was that the user 'root' on my computer did not have a password
* In order to fix this, I visited the PACE SQL documentation and followed the following steps:
** ran FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
** ran UPDATE USER SET password=password('_____<u>my_pass</u>______') where USER='root';
** ran FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
* These steps enabled me to get mysql running with a particular password, set by me

* Furthermore, we decided it would be good to clear the database between EMADE runs

'''Lecture Meeting Notes:'''
* Updated Zutty and rest of the team (who weren't able to make it to the separate work meeting) on my progress with our errors
'''Discussed Goal:'''
* Currently working towards accomplishing the '''<u>''first''</u>''' goal on this list, after which the rest should come quite easily:
** (1) Submit a job on PACE without it crashing immediately
** (2) Submit the script to run the MySQL server
** (3) Submit the script to run the unit test on PACE
** (4) Run for individuals with my primitive on PACE to get data for statistical tests
'''Process log for PACE issues:'''
* Finally now that the MySQL versioning seems to have been sorted out, I once again tried to submit the PBS script to the queue in order to launch the MySQL instance, and finally it did not error out immediately!
* Now that I was able to completely and effectively debug the reason for the MySQL instance not running properly on the queue, and it no longer crashed immediately after the job was submitted, I had that SQL instance running and decided to try and run something on it.
* In order to do this, I had to replace the host and password information in the template file with the address of the node running the database [for our purposes, this was input_summaries]
* After doing this, all of the configuration should have been ready to simple add the PBS script for EMADE onto the queue and running for data, however, I once again experienced the errors with my job immediately erring out. The following is an image of the error:
[[files/Scnshot1.png|center|thumb|780x780px]]
* The team seemed to think that thereÂ was a type and that it should be `xml` not `xsd`, so I went and edited this file
* However, it immediately became clear that this was not a typo whatsoever, and I was back to square one with this error.
* Then the team proposed that perhaps I didn't have all the python packages installed and Pulak suggested that maybe I could just try running `./reinstall.sh` in the EMADE directory
* He thought that perhaps it wasn't a problem with the file, but just something configuration-related that went wrong, so ideally reinstalling everything and trying to run should fix it
* The file itself seemed to have been corrupted because the shell script simply would not run properly, so I decided that since there were only three commands in the script, I would simply run them manually.[[files/SLACK3.png|center|thumb|600x600px]]
* However, when I ran them, I experienced the following error:[[files/Scnshot2.png|center|thumb|573x573px]]

* By this point, although I had not finished solving this error, Alex made some headway on other issues that were further down the line which we should also edit in our PACE environments, so then these changes were what I decided to work on for the upcoming week (along with solving my error)'''Action Items:'''

'''Lecture Meeting Notes:'''
* The beginning of distance learning
* BlueJeans is the platform we will be using for all virtual team meetings
* Had a discussion with the team regarding where we all last left off, and how to progress from there with our PACE problems so that we can accomplish our goal of having statistical tests by the end of the semester, as the very least
'''Discussed Goal:'''
* Upon joining this meeting, I had downloaded but not yet tried out the VPN needed to access the PACE server, so this would be the first step in beginning work in distance format
* Moving forward within the next couple days, I plan on meeting on bluejeans with Alex and Anuraag and whoever else can make the meeting, and figuring our how we can get around the PACE issues we are having, so that we can:
** (1) Submit a job on PACE without it crashing immediately
** (2) Submit the script to run the MySQL server
** (3) Submit the script to run the unit test on PACE
** (4) Run for individuals with my primitive on PACE to get data for statistical tests

* Working towards the first of the four goals listed above: (1) Submit a job on PACE without it crashing immediately
* The job that I am working towards running on PACE is the MySQL server instance through PBS script
* I am no longer getting the same errors, ever since I (1) updated the `environment.yml`, (2) updated the `pbsmysql.pbs` file, (3) wrote the `.my.cnf` file
* Now whenever I submit a job, the following error shows up in the qstat listing, and the job immediately errors out:
[[files/Pic1.png|center|thumb|535x535px]]
* On call with the rest of the team, we discussed different errors that we were all having and perhaps how to fix them. Once I got past the error in the outfiles from the run above, I began experiencing a new error[[files/Slack3.png|center|thumb|774x774px]]

* To resolve this error, my team suggested that I try simply deleting all the database-related folders, and reconfiguring the MySQL server structure from scratch, with proper versioning. To do this I once again followed the document Alex had written up, but this time in tandem with online PACE MySQL setup resources, and this time the error seemed to have solved itself

'''Personal Progress Notes:'''
* ''Although Alex, Anugraag and I met for 6-7 hours on the Sunday before the presentation, in addition to our team meeting on Friday, we were still not able to figure out all of the bugs with PACE such that we could get our runs to work with MySQL jobs submitting error-free''

'''Lecture Meeting Notes:'''
* PACE has been down for the past while and our progress has been paused
* Updated the team regarding the errors I was facing with the MySQL runs
* Helped test out the documentation for PACE that my team created, and told them where I was having issues with the instructions so that it could be fixed in iterative development, and would be foolproof documentation for the next group working with PACE
'''Discussed Goal:'''
* Working towards having proper results to present in the midterm presentation, because although I was able to run my unit test, due to problems with PACE this week, we have been unable to run jobs without a host of errors that we have never seen before.
* In order to work towards trying to uncover what changed with PACE, we have to change a few files to ensure certain environment variables have not changed (in case that is causing the issue with PACE - any version changes or environmental variables having been reset)
* Make note of the dos2unix converter
** Coverts to unix files for PBS scripts
* Then a proper setup with the PACE documentation had to be conducted once again, to ensure proper reset of the PACE environment, due to the maintenance period that changed our runs and took place the previous week

'''General Meeting Notes:'''
* Midterm hackathon meeting
* Personal goals to accomplish this meeting:
** Get final clarifications about running the PBS script from Alex, as the run itself will be done on my own time [once PACE is back up]
* Group goals to accomplish this meeting:
** Complete at least half of the team presentation
** Discuss what all is needed to be put on the team presentation
** Discuss next milestones, which would be completed by any first semester students on our team
'''Personal Completed Tasks Thus Far [this meeting]:'''
*Broke down the meaning of different aspects of a PBS script
**Notes:
***You need to be on campus, or connect via VPN
***Login Nodes: For logging in and submitting jobs
***Compute Nodes: For running codes/simulations
****No direct access by users
****Allocated per-job by the scheduler [when a job is "submitted"]
***Submitting batch jobs:
****Everything needs to be scripted (eg. a PBS script)
***PBS Script
****A âPBS scriptâ that includes resource requirements, environmental settings, and tasks
****Submitting a job: `qsub  file_name.pbs`
****Check on your submitted job: `qstat`
****Cancel a job: `canceljob <u>_PID_</u>`
***The output and error logs are printed into files [naming specified per script], as they would appear on the screen, and saved in the same directory as the corresponding script.
***Example PBS script w/ annotated meanings:

<nowiki>#</nowiki>PBS -N hello                                                            // Name of the run

<nowiki>#</nowiki>PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=4                                            // 3 nodes, 4 cores each [PACE specifications for this run]

<nowiki>#</nowiki>PBS -l pmem=2gb                                                   // 16GB memory usage total for the run

<nowiki>#</nowiki>PBS -l walltime=15:00:00                                        // Job is killed after 15 hours

<nowiki>#</nowiki>PBS -q coc-ice                                                        // Name of the queue

<nowiki>#</nowiki>PBS -j oe                                                                 // Puts [o]utput & [e]rror files in below format

<nowiki>#</nowiki>PBS -o myjob.out                                                    // Output files for the run

<nowiki>#</nowiki>PBS -m abe                                                             // Notify via email on start and end of job

<nowiki>#</nowiki>PBS -M youremail@gatech.edu                              // Email to send updates

* Writing my own PBS script to run the unit test primitive
** Now that I have broken down how to write the PBS file, I was able to write my own
** I used some of the following resources, as well:
*** http://latisresearch.umn.edu/creating-a-PBS-script
*** https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.19/user/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
** The output that I received when running my unit test and primitive are below
[[files/PACE run.png|alt=PACE run|center|thumb|458x458px]]
[[files/PACE run2.png|center|thumb|455x455px]]
* Completed my personal slides, explaining my primitive to first semester students, in order to show them what type of work they may potentially be doing for our team
[[files/Pres1.png|center|thumb|456x456px]]
[[files/Pres2.png|center|thumb|454x454px]]

* Now that I was able to activate my account on PACE ICE and I obtained EMADE on PACE ICE using the ssh key on gatech github, the next step is to be able to actually test the primitive which I wrote, on this platform using my unit test.
* To do so, I completed the conda environment setup on PACE this past week and have started work early, with communicated with Alex, on how to write the PBS scripts which allow us to run things on PACE
* Alex has given me a little bit of an overview on how to write a PBS script, where it belongs in the directories, etc.
* I have also found the following resource which I plan on using when I begin writing my own:

'''Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* Worked on tf-isf primitive
* Had difficulty iterating through the incoming data pair object from EMADE
* Were confused regarding how the tfidfvectorizer assigned values to data (what did the object return)
** https://kavita-ganesan.com/tfidftransformer-tfidfvectorizer-usage-differences/#.XefamzJKifW
*** This website helped me understand how a vectorizer worked, and the input/output of a vectorizer object
*** It also introduced the concept of a DataFrame object, which is used for visualization and traansparency of the data you are working with
*** We were able to utilize this later, when trying to understand the output of our tfisf function
** I found the following website that gave me more information about this:
*** https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html

* We decided that in order to truly observe how our primitive was working, at different stages in the tf-isf process, we needed sample data

* Received updates from the other sub teams as well
** ezCGP
*** Working on writing more effective code

'''Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* Asked general questions regarding how primitives work in EMADE
* Asked about how EMADE works with text processing
* Asked how our work (creating primitives) would play into the overall course of the NLP text summarization project [big picture view]
* Fellow team member Nesha and I were assigned the primitive tf-isf to create so that EMADE could use it to process incoming text data
* Provided with research paper as a resource to read about tf-isf, as the code we have to look at is only for tf-idf
** https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915006869
* Tf-idf
** "Term frequency inter document frequency"
** Assigns every term/word a particular tf-idf score
** The score would be lesser if the term appears in a document fewer times
** A lesser score indicates that the word is more important, as it is more rare
* Our task is to look at the tf-idf to understand how we should implement tf-isf
* Tf-isf
** "Term frequency inter sentence frequency"
'''Completing Assigned Task:'''
* I found the following resources, when doing background research about coding a TF-IDF function in Python
** https://towardsdatascience.com/tfidf-for-piece-of-text-in-python-43feccaa74f8
** https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tf-idf-model-for-page-ranking/
* Then I walked through the code provided on these sites, so that I could understand what may be the best way for me to write my function
* When I thought I had a good place to start, I began to code in Jupyter notebook

'''Lecture Meeting Notes:'''
* Cleaning data is the first step to creating a machine learning algorithm
* Tools:
**Pandas takes in CSVs and data files and represents them as tabular frames in python
*** Pandas functions allow you to replace rows and manipulate the data tables.
** Numpy
*** Allows for mathematical operations to be done on row/column data in the table
** Scikit
*** Enables the data training, testing and splitting process
*** Splits the data randomly between test and training data
* Model architectures
** Random forest
** Decision trees
* Codominance

'''Personal Notes:'''
* Regressions vs classifiers
** Regressions are for continuous data output (ie. predicting housing prices)
** Classifiers are for discrete data where there is only one answer (ie. who survived vs died, who won the election, what animal is in this image)
*** Survived vs died is a binary classifier
* Linear/Quadratic regression
** Rather than binary classification, regression predicts largely variable data output
** Videos: Andrew Ng [ML specialist at Stanford]
* Preprocessing
** Reducing dimensionality
** Dimensions are features
*** Titanic: gender, cabin level
** The model will get confused with too many features, and may overfit the model
* Testing
** Keep your testing and training data separate, so you can avoid overfitting your model to the data

* Important features identified:
** Keep in mind:
*** If data is incomplete (can fill in data that is incomplete, on your own)
** Definitely important:
*** Passengers class
*** Passengers sex
*** Passengers age
** Maybe important:
*** Passengers parch
*** Passengers fare

* In this way, when we are talking about mutations and crossovers in the 'individual', we are talking about mutations and crossovers in the algorithm.
* Trees are used to represent various aspects of a genetic program. In this way, it is easier to identify pieces which will later be mutated or merged with other trees as crossover.
* Leaf nodes = terminals
* Other nodes = primitives or operations
* Data storage for a program is done using lisp preordered parse trees.
* Mutations in genetic programming:
** Removing/adding/changing a node
** Removing/adding a subtree
* Crossovers in genetic programming:
** Genetic programming employs single point crossovers [subtrees are swapped from a single point on the tree]
* Weakly-typed genetic program: allows for the use of broader set of primitive values
* Strongly-typed genetic program: requires a certain type
* Evaluating a tree:
** Place an input into the tree, and compare tChe output with the truth.
** This allows you to measure the error.
* Complex primitives
** Can move past using basic operations as primitives (+, -, *, /) and can also use factorials and powers
** This allows for less complex trees, that are more efficient and easier to understand

'''Lecture Meeting Notes:'''
* Genetic Algorithms:
** Created using processes observed in nature, such as mating, mutation, and crossover.
** These processes are applied to individuals in the previous population, and then their fitness is evaluated.
** Theoretically, with numerous repetitions of the process, the best individual (one with idea fitness) would result.
* Objective:
** A value that is being either maximized or minimized, and is used as a benchmark to evaluate the fitness of an individual
* Fitness:
** Measure of how an individual compares to others, based on the objective.
** The higher the fitness value, the higher the probability of being chosen for mating.
* Crossover
** Represents mating between individuals.
* Mutation
** Random modifications, to maintain diversity, just as found in nature.
* Applying Algorithm to Population
** Initialize a population, randomly, and determine its fitness
*** Repeat:
**** Select parents from population
**** Perform crossover (creating new population)
**** Perform mutations on that population
**** Determine population fitness
** Example:
*** One Max Problem [Lab 1]
**** Begins with individuals that each have a list randomly instantiated with 1s or 0s
**** Goal: eventually produce an individual with a list of all 1s
