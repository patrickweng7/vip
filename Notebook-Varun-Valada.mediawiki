'''Presentation Notes:'''
* ADFs
** Finds useful subtrees to help explain why some individuals perform better
** They found that ADFs contribute to the pareto front more than the general population of individuals
** Differential fitness: change in fitness from parent to child
* NLP
** Putting Neural Networks into EMADE with Keras
** Added different primitives
* Ez-CGP
** Used image classifying dataset
** Transfer learning
** Created tensor flow primitives

== April 19th, 2020 ==
* I have finished 5 runs of EMADE with the parameters and have given the results to Josh so he can process them and put them into the presentation.
*We also showed our presentation to Dr. Zutty and Dr. Rohling so they could give us feedback on anything we could add or modify to the presentation to make it better.

* I presented on results from the .15 speciation threshold. For both bloat and hypervolume, the graphs comparing Baseline EMADE and 0.15 speciation are shown. There was no statistically significant difference between them with p values of 0.319 and 0.107 respectively.

== April 13th, 2020 ==
* At this point, I have completed 3 runs of EMADE with these parameters.
* To further fix the problem of EMADE running too long, Eric and Josh added a time cutout for any individual taking longer than 2 hours. This hopefully should make it easier to get runs completed

== April 6th, 2020 ==
* I have currently completed 1 run of EMADE with these parameters.
* However, this process took several hours and still did not get to 50 generations even after running it overnight. Since this might be a problem with us needing data by the presentation, we cut the number of runs each of us should do and reduced the number of generations to 30.

== March 30th, 2020 ==
* Installed Josh's bloat control fork of EMADE and attempted to run it on the Titanic Data set with a speciation threshold of .15 with unrestricted mating for 50 generations .
** https://github.gatech.edu/efrankel6/emade/blob/fitness_sharing/src/GPFramework/EMADE.py - these parameters can be set in line 680
* Ran into a couple of errors
**   AttributeError: 'numpy.float64' object has no attribute 'translate'
* This error seems to have to do with how numbers are put into SQL tables and you can't put it numpy.float64, so we had to cast it to a float. 
** Changed line 187 in https://github.gatech.edu/efrankel6/emade/blob/fitness_sharing/src/GPFramework/sql_connection_orm_master.py to:
*** self.session.add(self.Bloat(generation=float(gens_elapsed), bloat=float(bloat), hypervolume=float(hypervolume), tree_size=float(tree_size)))
* This change allowed EMADE to run with no hiccups so far.

== March 23rd, 2020 ==
* Joined the Bloat Control team and was given an introduction/a couple of assignments to complete in the coming weeks.
* Notes on Neat-GP Paper
** Common theory on Bloat is the Fitness Causes Bloat Theory which asserts that since there are more large programs than small programs that produce a desired fitness level, GP tends to find solutions that are unnecessarily large.
** Crossover Bias Theory(CBT): crossover skews distribution of trees to be large number of small trees. Since small trees generally perform poorly on complex problems, this biases against them.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Watched team presentations to learn about different teams.

== February 19th, 2020 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Learned about EMADE
** Input files/ Configures moving parts in EMADE
*** Python configurations
*** MySQL Configuration
*** Datasets Configuration
** Vectorization: one-hot encoding of categorical data -> [0, 1, 0] instead of 2 so ML Algorithm doesn't learn relationships about distance.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Learned about how to give a technical presentation
[[files/EvolutionaryAlgoParetoFront.png|thumb|Pareto Frontier for Evolutionary Algorithm]]
* Planned out meeting time to work on creating the Pareto frontier for our ML algorithms and Genetic Algorithm, and to work on presentations.
'''Subteam Meeting Notes:'''
* Worked on creating and running our Genetic Programming Algorithm and creating the Pareto Frontier. 
* Finished creating our presentation for this.

== January 29th, 2020 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Got an introduction to Pandas and Scikit Learn libraries in Python
* Joined team to analyze Titanic data set to implement our own machine learning algorithm and plot them on a Pareto Frontier.
'''Subteam Meeting Notes'''
* Assigned Neural Network to train on Titanic Data
* After playing with some of the parameters, I settled on 3 hidden layers with 64, 8 and 2 nodes respectively. 
** Surprisingly, this didn't overfit and yielded the highest accuracy
** Code can be found at https://github.gatech.edu/schoudhury40/TitanicProjectGroup1/blob/master/titanic_nn.py

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Learned more about Genetic Programming
** Gene pool: set of me to be evaluated during the current generation
** Confusion Matrix: True positive/negative and false positive/negative table 
** Sensitivity: True Positive Rate
** Specificity: True Negative Rate
** Pareto Optimality
*** An individual is Pareto if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individual on all objectives
*** The set of all Pareto individuals is known as the Pareto frontier
*** Area Under Curve(AUC)/Hypervolume: area under Pareto Frontier → want to see it go down as population evolves

== January 15th, 2020 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Learned about Genetic Programming
** The individual that gets evolved is the function itself
** Nodes: "primitives" - represent functions
** Leaves: "terminals" - represent parameters
** Crossover: exchanging subtrees
** Mutation in GP
*** Inserting a node/subtree
*** Removing a node/subtree
*** Changing node/subtree

==January 8th, 2020==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
*Learned some introductory information about genetic algorithms and how they work.
*Notes from the lecture:
**Individual: Specific candidate the population
***Objective: value that individual achieves - think grade
***Fitness: how the value stacks up to others in population - think rank • Selection: ’survival of the fittest’
***Fitness Proportionate: greater fitness = higher probability of being selected – Tournament: individuals are directly compared, winners get to mate
***Mate/Crossover: swaps over individuals over points • Mutations: random changes to maintain diversity
