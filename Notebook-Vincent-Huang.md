### Week 2: Aug 30
- Joined modularity subteam
- Split leadership roles
    - Since team is basically split in half between regular and time conflict meetings, split leadership role
    - Bernadette leads discussion for time conflict, I'll lead Monday discussions
    - Look into combining entire team into the time conflict section
- More brainstorming ideas
    - Do baseline run on stock team’s data
        - https://github.gatech.edu/rbhatnager3/emade/tree/stocks-pr
    - New Models
        - Deep Ensembles with a diversity term
        - A CNN architecture with decaying learning rate
    - Selection Method
        - Modifying the evolutionary selection method to help encourage the spread of ARLs throughout the population and complexity. 
    - New Dataset Training
        - Look at other datasets to expand ARL training to see which ARLs stored in the database are the most used and why.
        - Practice on more image datasets and multi-class classification datasets.
    - Diversity Measures
        - Create some quantifiable way to measure diversity, generalizable for EMADE. May use a diversity measure as a heuristic when finding ARLs.
    - ARL Database Storage
        - Improve the way ARLs are stored in the database to keep any information from being lost
    - EMADE Integration
        - Integrate ARLs with EMADE’s original architecture and other modularity techniques

### Week 1: Aug 23
- Brainstorming topics, deciding subteams
    - Modularity
        - Finishing work from last semester, primarily extending depth beyond depth 2.
        - Finishing up mnist runs from last semester.
        - Fixing "super individuals" problem, could be caused by correlated objectives.
    - Infrastructure
        - Modify EMADE to use a distributed system instead of a single master and multiple workers
        - Add additional printing output so that users can know when errors occur without checking master file
        - Automatically close process during fatal error
        - Explore different data storage options besides mysql
    - EZCGP
    - Covid Data
        - Run emade to predict covid trends within communities
