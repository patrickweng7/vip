'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Overview of subteams, for ezCGP Dr Jason showed concerned on fitness values in mating snapshot on individuals we shared in snapshot in status report
* I explained these are not best individuals, and comparison was not complete yet, as run to run there are variations.
* In breakout: we discussed on our slides status
* Discussed with team on how to present plots for One-Point crossover method,
* Rodd suggested to just share different runs plot in single stacked over each other, that will give good comparison.
* Checked with Rodd if there is way to standalone run with mating only, but there is no such way as per him.

'''Sub Team Notes:'''
* In meeting on Thursday, went through slides and did some final finishes
* Everything looked fine, except for some speaker notes.

'''OnePointCrossover Mating Method:'''
* Did one run with 2 generations and 2 individuals to visualize individuals mating process
* But since ezCGP didn't run with mating standalone, put debugging code to track parents and child and the genome ids which got swapped
* Plotted parents and individuals from generation 2, and from debugged data, draw the individuals after mating only and verified mating process, [https://wiki.vip.gatech.edu/mediawiki/images/c/cd/Mating_process1.jpeg here is the snapshot of it]:
[[files/Mating_process1.jpeg]]

* Also, for runs with Pagie-1 problem which runs over default settings of 50 generations,
* Wrote [https://github.gatech.edu/vgupta342/AAD_group1/blob/master/plot_curve.py script] to plot curves of different runs with and without mating for better comparison
* First plotted with 10 runs of each, but graph got too much messed up, then finally picked 3 distinctive runs from each.
[[files/Mating_plot.jpeg]]

* From different runs, main key takeaway is that with mating which included mutation as well, best score or absolute error reduced a lot in initial generations,
but then it didn't reduce much in further generations as seen in most of runs, 
with mutation only, although it takes more generations to reduce error, but it gives better best score finally as seen in most of runs.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Dr Jason reminded of final PPT date
* Overview of sub teams, for ezCGP Dr Jason asked to demonstrate, in Final PPT, 2 runs with and w/o dense layers.
* In breakout: discussed on slides to prepare
* Rodd assigned different tasks for mating team:
1. Mating methods:  -  ( Vishesh: one-point cross over )
- find out how its implemented and how to implement it
- After meeting, Rodd shared the template and branch to checkin the code.

2. Meta evolution or parameter search  ( Lucas and Monil )
- slightly alter main method….may be they can create list of parameters and randomly pick from there.

3. 1+lambda Evol strategy….play around different mutation method ( Justin and Parshva )

'''Sub Team Notes:'''
* On meeting on thursday, all team members decided on PPT outline
* Daniel created shared slide and noted down outlines in slide
* Everyone picked topics to present
* I asked team on how to run visualize.py,
* Daniel guided on some steps and then I could plot individual in draw.io

'''OnePointCrossover Mating Method Implementation:'''
* Rodd created issue in zenhub (#170) and shared the branch to use for implementation
* Reviewed the BlockMate methods and looked into it how genome is maintained right now
* Till now, code did not do any splitting,
* Implemented to randomly pick point but in first half of the tree (though we have single chain ie. linked list in genome) following the [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2488946_Genetic_Programming_with_One-Point_Crossover_and_Point_Mutation research paper]
* Swapped the rest of genome with other one, hence we got 2 new offsprings having crossover
* Tested the code, faced some compilation issue, turns out I needed to import the class in problem of symbolic regression
* finally ran the code, and got some results, looked into log.txt
* found that best score dropped abruptly in most cases, but reduces faster in initial generations, then change lesser in further generations.
* Pushed the code in [https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/tree/feature/Issue170-Mating_OnePointCrossover OnePointCrossover branch]
* Tried to visualize individuals, but faced issue with visualize.py, kept on getting compilation error on "codes module not found"
* After meeting on Thursday, got visualization issue fixed, now I can see different individuals like one as below:

== Week 13: April 12, 2021 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Dr Jason took overview from all teams
* In breakout session, we finished the research paper on mating methods
* Rodd assigned different problems: Koza-3, Nguyen-4, Nguyen-7, Pagie-1 to each of us to run symbolic regression
* I was odd one out as we were 5 members, so I got to pick myself and picked Pagie-1 because it has additional complexity to deal with 2 variables.

'''Sub Team Notes:'''
* Rodd shared the code template on how to change git branch and checkout
* Gave overview of the [https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/blob/feature/SymbolicRegression-BASE/problems/problem_symbolicRegression_TEMPLATE.py code template] and changes we need to do and where
* Justin shared one issue on values coming out to be infinite and nan in error
* on further debugging, turns out its logarithmic function where log 0 is infinite
* Later, Rodd shared the code to handle it for now.

'''Symbolic Regression problem using Pagie-1 as mentioned in [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77553-1_13 research paper Table5]:'''
* Already did checkout the branch in meeting and partially implemented the code
* Completed the code implementation, but when run it, faced error on unsuperscribtable output variable, type is None,
* I suspected it because of second input, Rodd did gave hint on how to put that
* but when I removed it and ran it, it ran with no error with single input variable
* I looked into the code inside and wondered why self.x of [https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/blob/431bfbe16ad799aaf7bcadb69631bf3060b791a9/data/data_tools/ezData.py#L51 ezData_numpy] cannot take multiple arrays of values, I didn't see any issue with that.
* So, I further looked into rest of problems how they are handling multiple inputs,
* and turns out [https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/blob/431bfbe16ad799aaf7bcadb69631bf3060b791a9/data/data_tools/ezData.py#L127 ezData_EMADE] also doing same thing, all training features are in 2D array and assigned to train_data
* so I tried the same way in [https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/blob/68be0be08e8c6b1801028bf379be2115515b497f/problems/problem_symbolicRegression_PAGIE1.py#L68 construct_dataset of Pagie1 problem at line 81] and it worked and from log.txt of output, it seems it give correct output and [https://github.com/ezCGP/ezCGP/blob/feature/SymbolicRegression-VISHESH/problems/problem_symbolicRegression_PAGIE1.py pushed the code]
* I found best score at generation 0th was: 18.231715026195303 and reduce to 8.495544385454545 till generation: 24th, but after it remain almost same as of generation 24th, it ran till 50th generation.

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Statistics Lecture
* Rodd shared research paper on [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77553-1_13 comparison of mating methods] to read in next sub team meeting

'''Sub Team Notes:'''
* Read the research paper on [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77553-1_13 A Comparative Study on Crossover in Cartesian Genetic Programming] 
* Introduction on it, as summarised by Rodd
  - comparative study on cross over methods
  - our focus is on experimental side of paper
  - understand the experimental process which will help us in conducting the same
  - scientifically make statement about idea
  - what domains did experiment run in, what kind of problems, datasets, how we keep clean and neat things etc.
  - write mating methods to experiment on.

'''Notes on research paper:'''

* Experimental setup 
4.1 section
  - problems on symbolic regression and Boolean functions
  - objective: minimize fitness
  - 4 crossover operators
  - uses generational model
  - initialise with random population
  - parent genomes

  - separate tournaments, why ??
  - even though parents selected….repeated process to create multiple offsprings until some limit
  - picked best individuals and offsprings for next generation

  - Hypothesis 1: Baseline/Reference: None crossover seems very similar to 1+lambda
    Where lambda = 1 because children are exact clones + mutation

  - what performs better mean ?
  - what evolution parameters like population size, size of genomes, how many nodes in genomes, % of best individuals are gonna be carried over.
  - pick 2 most important parameters 

* Meta-evolution:
  Meta level : basic canonical GA
  - seems like they did some trials and took mean
  - and came up with evolved parameters
  - tournament selection was fixed of size 4
  - parameter sweep set to avg 15%

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Missed class due to Canvas doesn't update Daylight hours change w.r.t IST, anyway went through the meeting recording.
* Found out I may be facing issues due to wrong DEAP version
* Noted relevant SQL queries to try out.


'''Sub Team Notes:'''
* Finalised team meetings times to held on Friday 8 pm to complete Titanic assignment with Emade and Sunday 1 pm to complete PPT.
* Sharing findings/issues with Emade on groupme.
* In meeting on Friday, Kevin started Emade as master, then we followed as worker
   * On Sequel Pro, we could observe individuals evaluation status changing from NOT_EVALUATED to IN_PROGRESS or WAITING_FOR_MASTER.
   * Helped others with issues on Emade, some had issues with py version, or some had not set python config and db config in input_titanic.xml
   * Helped one by one by having their screen shared, tried them to resolve issues, and start Emade and join as worker on our common db.
   * Kept Emade running for 2-3 hours
* Kevin shared output files on [https://github.gatech.edu/vgupta342/AAD_group1 github]
* In meeting on Sunday, discussed on output data we got, started preparing Final PPT Emade slides
   * Distributed the slides among us to complete
   * Then, decided who will present what, and decided to rehearse 1 or half an hour before class on Monday (22nd).


'''Titanic Assignment using Emade (on common mysql server):'''
* Facing issue of Emade not going above 0th generation, seems to be hanged at 0th year. Laters Turns out it was not issue, it was just taking longer time.
* Reinstalled DEAP with 1.2.2.
* Ran Emade as worker on common server, observed data and individuals on Sequel pro, using following QUERY:
      select count(evaluation_status) from titanic.individuals group by evaluation_status;
* Individuals kept on changing, as run progressed, individuals changed to EVALUATED status fast when more workers joined
* Also, monitored number of generations completed using following QUERY:
       select count(generation) from titanic.history group by generation;
* After run completed 21 generations, then it kind of stuck or started taking more longer time.
* Kept on exporting Pareto Individuals at different generations using following query in csv file to ensure we get something, if db gets corrupted or lost somehow.
       select * from individuals join paretofront on individuals.hash=paretofront.hash where paretofront.generation=(select max(generation) from paretofront);


'''Titanic Assignment: Analyse output data'''
* Collected number of valid individuals over generations, but they didn't change much, curve and SQL query in [https://github.gatech.edu/vgupta342/AAD_group1/blob/master/Pareto%20curves_emade.ipynb curve in In(60) of notebook]
* Pareto Individuals did increase linearly over generations, max to 38 in 21st generation, curve and SQL query in [https://github.gatech.edu/vgupta342/AAD_group1/blob/master/Pareto%20curves_emade.ipynb curve in In(50) of notebook]
* Collected valid individuals and pareto individuals, and plotted their False Negatives and False Positives, graph and SQL queries in [https://github.gatech.edu/vgupta342/AAD_group1/blob/master/Pareto%20curves_emade.ipynb curve in In(63) of notebook]

'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Discussed with problems facing in Emade with Jason, turns out it was connection to mysql server
* Tried with local server of mysql, Emade worked
* But with common server team had setup, it did not connect, worked with Kevin to try resolving the issue.

'''Sub Team Notes:'''
* Had meeting on Tuesday 7th March, to catch up with the team
* Worked on to resolve issues with common server connection,
* Tried multiple things like connecting on VPN, disconnecting from VPN
* Finally, due to Kevin's effort with connection on AWS, we could connect to common server and could able to run EMADE on it.

'''Titanic Assignment using Emade (on local mysql server):'''
* Ran Emade till 16 generations
* Faced issue in connecting to Sequel pro to analyse data
* After spending some time, found out it was Sequel pro latest release bug, there is test build which runs fine
* After installing [https://sequelpro.com/test-builds test Build 5446], it worked fine.

* Next meeting on Tuesday 23 Feb 5:30 PM to wrap up, merge results in one csv file and finalise PPT. ([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DiFwUJEN5xpyITsAEd51G6mbpr2DsT0NN3l6UQVKb1Y/edit meeting notes])
* All team members developed Pareto optimal solution as below curve:
 [[files/Pareto_curve_MOGP.jpeg]]

'''Titanic Assignment part2 (using MOGP):'''
* Tried different primitives, decided not to use power primitive as accuracy dropped.
* Used NSGA2 for selection method, cxOnePointLeafBiased for mate and mutNodeReplacement for mutation
* Tried to run over 50 generations but faced memory stack full issue, so reduced to 40
* Tried 2 evaluation functions, but getting better accuracy with the one Kevin created.
* Collected predictions.csv from everyone and merged into predictions.csv having each of us result in each separate column.
* Developed Pareto Front curves for both ML and MOGP approach using lab2 code using least square method, and shared with team,
* Compared two approaches by putting on same scale in single graph, got following pareto front curve:

'''Titanic Assignment part1 (using ML):'''
* I was assigned Correlation Matrix with Heatmap for Feature Selection, ran it and shared the [[https://github.gatech.edu/vgupta342/AAD_group1/blob/master/Correlation%20Matrix%20with%20HeatMap.ipynb  results]].
* After collecting results from all 3 techniques: Univariate Selection, Feature Importance and HeatMap, did analysis on which features are irrelevant.
* Found tie between Parch and SibSp in their scores with both being in lower scores, though SibSp scored very low in univariate selection, tried taking Parch and SibSp mean or sum but correlation reduced.
* Used QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis Classifier model and found co-dominant solution with following results:

== Week 3: February 3, 2021 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''

* Multiple Objectives - The MO in MOGA and MOGP: Objective is to recognise power of multi objective optimisations in supplying a population of solutions, instead of single objective.
* focus on the translation of vector of scores from evaluation into a fitness value.
* Gene pool - set of genomes to be evaluated during current generation.   
* Search Space - set of algorithms
* Objective Space - The evaluation of a Genome associates a genome/individual (set of parameters for GA or string for GP) with a set of scores.
   * What are these scores ?
      * TP (True Positive) - How often we identify the desired object
      * FP (False Positive) - How often we identify something else as the desired object
      * Others are:  FP (False Positive - Type I Error) and  FN (False Negative - Type II Error) 
* Classification Measures and example covered in [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/reference_material/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture_3_Multiple_Objectives/Lecture%203.pptx Lecture slides 10 and 11]]

* Maximization Measures - develops a curve between Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR = TP / (TP + FN)) and Specificity or True Negative Rate (TNR = TN / (TN + FP) ),  bigger is better.
* Minimization Measures - develops a curve between False Negative Rate ( FNR = FN / (TP + FN) ) and Fallout or False Positive Rate ( FPR = 1 - TNR ), smaller is better.
* Examples covered in [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/reference_material/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture_3_Multiple_Objectives/Lecture%203.pptx slides 14 to 17]]

* Other Measures:
  * PPV (Positive or Precision Predictive Rate) = TP / (TP + FP) , bigger is better
  * False Discovery Rate, FDR = FP / (TP + FP), smaller is better
  * Negative Predictive Value, NPV = TN / (TN + FN), bigger is better
  * Accuracy, Acc = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN), bigger is better 

* Objective Space: each individual evaluated using objective functions like mean square error, cost, complexity etc, objective scores give each individual a point in objective space, which can referred to as phenotype of the individual, example is in [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/reference_material/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture_3_Multiple_Objectives/Lecture%203.pptx Lecture slide 20 ]]
* Pareto Optimality: An individual is Pareto optimal if no other individual can outperforms individual on all objectives. The set of all Pareto Individuals is known as Pareto Frontier. Prefer to drive selection by favouring Pareto Individuals, but maintain diversity as well. Curve in [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/reference_material/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture_3_Multiple_Objectives/Lecture%203.pptx Lecture slide 21]]

* Following are 2 Algorithms:
  * NSGA II:  Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm ||, refer to [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/reference_material/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture_3_Multiple_Objectives/Lecture%203.pptx slide 22]]
  * SPEA 2: Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, refer to [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/reference_material/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture_3_Multiple_Objectives/Lecture%203.pptx slides 23 and 24]]

'''Lab2 Part2:'''

Followed the instructions and steps as mentioned in  [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/blob/master/notebooks/Lab%202%20-%20Genetic%20Programming%20and%20Multi-Objective%20Optimization.ipynb emade/Lab2]]

* Part 2: Multi-Objective Genetic Programming
   * Aim: To minimize 2 objective: mean square error and size of tree
   * Added 3 new primitives: sin, cos and tan
   * pareto dominance function defined to return true if the first individual dominates the second individual.
   * sort our population by pareto dominance in comparison to the separate individual
   * plot our objective space using our sorted population as follows:
            [[files/Lab2_part2_curve1.jpeg]]

   * After running main algorithm, following result we get:
            [[files/Lab2_part2_curve2.jpeg]]

   * Visualise our objective space to show our Pareto front: (The lower our AUC is, the better our pareto front is)

== Week 2: January 27, 2021 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Genetic Programming: instead of taking individual evaluation, have function evaluator to obtain objective score, where individual is function itself
* Tree Represenation:  Represent a program as a tree structure, in which:
   * Nodes are called primitives and represent functions
   * Leaves are called terminals and represent parameters.
   So, input is a type of terminal and root is output.

* Tree Representation Examples are discussed in Lecture slides 5 to 7 [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/reference_material/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture_2_GP/Lecture_2_GP.pptx]]
* Tree is converted to a "Lisp preordered parse tree", basically, its pre-order traversal.
 
* Crossover in GP: swap subtree which can be leaf or middle node and nodes below it or may be root itself!!
* Mutation in GP:  Insert/delete/change a node/subtree

* Symbolic Regression (Taylor series for sin x) and third order traversal example in Lecture Slides 11 to 13 [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/reference_material/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture_2_GP/Lecture_2_GP.pptx]]

'''Lab2 Part1:'''

Followed the instructions and steps as mentioned in emade/Lab2  [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/blob/master/notebooks/Lab%202%20-%20Genetic%20Programming%20and%20Multi-Objective%20Optimization.ipynb]]

* Part 1: Symbolic Regression
   * Individuals represented as primitive tree, instead of list
   * In the primitive set, add mathematical operations: add, subtract, multiply, negative
   * Added 2 new primitives: sin and power
   * In toolbox, expr function returns a primitive tree based on a primitive set and a minimum which is 1 and maximum tree depth which is 2.
   * In eval function, Compile tree into function and determine mean square error between the function we compile and the actual function we are trying to generate.
   * In mutations, added one more mutate method: mutInsert

   * Tried different runs:
      1.  first run with above configuration:
      First run result: [[files/Lab2_first_run_result.jpeg]]

      First run plot: [[files/Lab2_first_curve.jpeg]]

      2.   second run with max depth 3, 
      Second run result: [[files/Lab2_second_run_result.jpeg]]

      Second run plot: [[files/Lab2_second_curve.jpeg]]

      3.  third run with max depth 5 and replaced mutate method mutInsert with mutNodeReplacement.
      Third run result: [[files/Lab2_third_run_result.jpeg]]

      Third run plot: [[files/Lab2_third_curve.jpeg]]

== Week 1: January 20, 2021 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Genetic Algorithms: involves numerous matings/mutations of individuals in the previous population, produce best individual
* KEY TERMS
   * Individual :   a candidate in population
   * Population:  group of individuals
   * Objective:    value used to characterise….score a test
   * Fitness:       (similar to objective)….relative comparison to other individuals
   * Evaluation:   takes an individual …computes its objective through function
   * Selection:    survival of the fittest….preference to best individuals
         — Fitness Proportionate: selection on normalised score, higher the score ie. larger is the pie, higher chance to be picked.
         — Tournament:                 random pull from population….more nosier and random…percent chance could be based on fitness
    * Mate/Crossover:  mating b/w individuals...pictorial eg in Lecture PPT [[https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/files/Part_1_(Genetic_Algorithm).pptx]] slide 6
    * Mutate:            random modifications, purpose is to maintain diversity....eg in Lecture PPT [[https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/files/Part_1_(Genetic_Algorithm).pptx]] slide 6

* Algorithm:  steps in Lecture PPT [[https://vip.gatech.edu/wiki/index.php/files/Part_1_(Genetic_Algorithm).pptx]] slide 8

'''Lab1:'''

Part 1: One Max Problem

Followed the instructions and steps as mentioned in emade/Lab1 [[https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/blob/master/notebooks/Lab%201%20-%20Genetic%20Algorithms%20with%20DEAP.ipynb]]

The objective is to find a bit string containing all 1s with a set length with maximising objective of 100. After multiple runs, it reaches maximum to 99.

One Max Results of 2 runs are in below snapshot:
[[files/Lab1 One Max.jpeg]]

Part 2: The N Queens Problem

The problem is to create configuration of N Queens on chessboard, so that no Queen can be taken by another one ie. each can be one line and column.
Then, following same steps as of Part1, except for maximising objective, here objective is to minimise to 0.

Final plot with the overall fitness decreases:
