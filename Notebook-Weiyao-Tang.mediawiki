=== Modularity Team meeting ===
* First-semester students are assigned the future ideas part of the final presentation since we just joined the team.
** We mainly focused on thinking of new ARL ideas
** I noticed that the current ARL implementation only searches for combinations of child node and its most fit parent, which is a depth of 1. If we could increase the depth, that is, makes the child node being compared with multiple ancestors, the outcome might be improved.
** Since ARL has an altruistic approach where a global pool of subtrees is kept for use by all individuals, we could design a way to use ARLs to replace searching through the population for certain individuals

* Help Kevin Lu to join new_section as a worker process
** Being reminded to check the workersPerHost parameter on XML file before run anything on your local. If that number is too big it might blow up my machine. If running locally then 1 is recommended.

=== Modularity Team meeting ===
* We are given the lecture introducing the p-value 
** I am quite familiar with p-value since I just took Math 3215, and it is the data to test whether we should accept our null hypothesis (the hypothesis to be tested)
** If the p-value is 2.5%, it shows that there is 2.5% percentage that the result is due to random chance.
** We want our p-value to be as low as possible to achieve statistical significance.

=== First semester's meeting ===
* Emailed Gabe multiple time about the setup and seeding issue on google colab
* The setup issue was finally solved by reinstalling the MySQL and conda on my local.
* During Oct 30th's meeting, we are introduced step by step about how to seed and run as a worker on AWS through google collab.
** Manually upload the whole Github repo onto Google Drive (delete all unneeded dataset to speed up uploading)
** Seeding is not required since my branch only served as a worker.

==== Preparation ====
Finally fixed the bug of the client_server.h file not found error during Emade set up
* Connect to Steven's server and run as the worker
* Due to the time limit, there are finally 20-30 runs in total.
* Going over and improve the slide during the group meeting.
* Being assigned to introduce the outcome utilizing Machine Learning and Genetic Programming.

=== '''Lecture: EMADE Set Up''' ===
In the lecture meeting, we mainly addressed steps to installing EMADE and problems associated with the setup process

Assignment:
* Set up my SQL on your local computer (5.7 is preferred)
* Have one teammate worked as a master branch and other teammates should connect as workers.
* Run for a number of generations
* Compare the result with ML and MOGP assignments, and do a presentation on Oct 21st
Emade Set up:
* Worked with Qichen to figure out the set up of MySQL

* Everything works fine except for the /bash reinstall.sh, tried to fixed it through email Dr. Zutty and consult with teammates

* Preprocess the data set to edit, delete and merge unnecessary attributes.
** Dropped 'Name', 'Cabin', 'Ticket', 'Parch', 'Embarked'
** Kept 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Fare' 
** Replaced NaN â€˜Ageâ€™ and â€˜Fareâ€™ values with the mean values of each column
** Coded the â€˜Sexâ€™ column into boolean values ({'male': 0, 'female': 1})
* Split dataset into training dataset (70%) and test dataset(30%).
* Apply KNN algorithm to predict.
