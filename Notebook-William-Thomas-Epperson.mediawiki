** Change EMADE code so that each individual has references to its parents
** Visualization of the ancestral lineage in phenotypic/objective space (i.e., what was the objective scores of the parents/grandparents that resulted in the current individual)
** Visualization of the ancestral lineage in genotypic/tree structure space (i.e., what parts of an individual came from each of the parents)
** Visualization of the evolutionary processes, (i.e. what mutations, selections, mating are occurring that are positive, and which are detrimental?)
** How many times is an individual selected over time? 
** How productive are their offspring, i.e. are they dominate or co-dominate to the parents or population?

== Week 4: January 28 - February 4, 2019 ==
'''Team Meeting Notes:'''
* Discussion:
** Viability of Heroku app
*** It seems like we are solving a problem that isn’t there
*** Heroku app was meant to be simpler
**** No simple way to connect local DB
**** A lot of code needs to be written to set up uploading a csv
*** Having user set up a local env to run EMADE-Viz is actually fairly easy
**** With a requirements file, it is very easy to locally set up Flask
* Todo’s
** Create a guide to setting up EMADE-Viz with a virtual environment - Anthony
** Meet to discuss testing with other teams - Anthony and Carissa
** Fix AUC graph - Michael
** Dashboard UI - Jeff and Will and Sierra
** Talk to Jason about hereditary visualizations - Will
** Visualization of # of pareto individuals over time - Suraj
** Make sure all code is merged - Everyone
*Notes from Class meeting
**Since UI changes and refactor almost done, transitioning into new visualizations / graphs we can create
**Ideas
***Number of pareto individuals over time: line graph of # pareto vs generation -- Suraj
***DAG of individuals in generation connected to their offspring in next generation
***(similar to above but better) From greg, visualization of inheritance in ''objective'' space. Ability to select individual and highlight where their parents are in objective space on FP / FN graph. Requires edits to EMADE to keep track of individual's parents' hash -- I'm going to start looking into this
***Visualization in ''genotypic'' space. For instance, ability to look at tree of individual and pinpoint which parts of tree come from which parent / mutations. This requires further edits to EMADE and will likely be tackled late in semester.

'''Problem Notes:'''
* Discovered bug that was causing all individuals to error out due to SQL error after 1st mating. Was able to fix with James's help.
* Created rough draft of hereditary viz. Some notes:
** Bokeh is not well built for interactive visualizations, for this to be effective I think it should be fully implemented / rewritten in a front end language like JS using D3
** Still have a lot of parents for some individuals, but most are not stored in DB so seems like the intermediate individuals are being logged (although this was not supposed to be happening). Going to have Michael look at this
** In current state, hereditary graph has normal pareto front and when hovering it plots all of the parents. If a parent is hovered over, it plots it's parents and so on.
** I did not add this graph into our dashboard since it is still a rough draft

== End of Semester Presentation / Reflection ==
'''Notes from end of semester Presentations'''
*Stocks
** Didn't get emade working with it
** Made lots of financial primitives
* Caching
** Not clear that caching was an improvement
** Lots of theory on caching and how to optimize cache invalidation
* EEG
** Binary classification task whether or not someone's eyes are opened or closed (?)
* Deep
** Using Cartesian Genetic Programming
** Different teams doing regression and classification 

'''End of Semester Reflection'''

I think I was able to add enough significant contributions to my Sub-team this semester to merit an A. At the beginning of the semester, I was able to lead the redesign / UI changes to make our platform easier to use and more aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, I worked to refactor the mode and modularize it so that it can be more easily extensible. After that I focused most of my efforts on doing the hereditary visualization. Although I did not make as much progress here as I would have liked, I think the proof on concept I developed will be useful in future semesters. Throughout this time, I was able to help organize and prioritize which problems our team needed to work on so that we could continue to improve EMADE Viz and make it a successful and useful platform.
