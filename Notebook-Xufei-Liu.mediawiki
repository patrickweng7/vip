====== Midterm Presentations ======
* Arrived late due to class conflict
* Bootcamp Subteam 3
** Data pre-processing
*** Dropped PassengerID, Ticket, Cabin, and added a column for relatives
*** Used one-hot encoding for genders and name titles
*** Mapped ages and fares to integers
*** Created a column called "gender_embarked" that combined gender and embarked port
*** Missing values are replaced with mean of features
** Machine learning models testing
*** AUC is 0.19
** MOGP
*** Used strongly typed primitives
*** Added third objective of tree size to evaluation function
* Stocks
** Goals
*** Use EMADE for regression on times series data
*** Trying to beat SOTA using trading algorithms
*** Determine Technical Indicators and Machine Learning Learners to determine which have the best analysis
** Recreating and Improving on their past paper
* Bootcamp 4
** Notice that learners can handle multicollinearity
** Accuracy stagnated after preprocessing
** Gets rid of duplicate individuals
** Very similar to other bootcamp groups

====== Lecture Notes ======
* Midterm presentations on Monday!
* Modularity
** Include design of experiments
** Look at objectives, auc, and also individuals for the stocks data.
** add 0 to reuse parameter in input template
* Stocks
** Close to matching the performance of the stocks paper
* Compute time is number of jobs that are running * number of cores per worker

====== Personal Exploration ======
* change scoop parameter to localrunparameters
* Add in maxadfsize and shoulduseadfs to evolution paramters for input file
* Change evalfunctions to eval_methods

====== Lecture Notes ======
* This Saturday, we will have a hackathon
* Modularity
** Squeue error for permission, and squeue is slurm
** Need to use new code from newer emade branch to not get an squeue error.

====== Saturday Hackathon 10/16/2021 ======
* Working on completing an emade run
** Previous syntax error due to copying over the launchEMADE.py file wrong.
* Check evolution parameters - shoulduseadfs
* Ran into lightgbm error from last semester. used conda install lightgbm
* no module named sep - insteall sep.

====== Subteam Meeting 10/21/2021 ======
* Temporarily switching over to google collab
** Pull over stocks file from datasets and the input stocks file from templates
** Bernadette managed to transfer over files and we all copied from her google collab account
* Midterm presentation is here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lus6qHH9vwdfaLxcBg50PBBOl56qF_A7wFGT4F-1hlI/edit#slide=id.g812dce5abf_2_375

====== Personal Exploration ======
* First run cd/usr
* Then mysqld_safe --datadir='/storage/home/hpaceice1/xliu725/scratch/db'
* New terminal: qsub -I -q pace-ice -l nodes=1:ppn=1,walltime=01:00:00
* exit
* mysql -u root
* Working on the stocks dataset
** First, copy over pace-ice functionality into the input stocks data
** Next, change the selection method to sel_nsga2 instead of NSGA2
** Add in the code for <ShouldUseADFs>false</ShouldUseADFs>
** In the future, we can change this to true when we want to use ADFs.
* Worked on the presentation
** Offered to do a run for titanic without arls
** Whoever gets a run first should send something in the slack channel.
** Need to add in the evaluation method for sel_nsga2.
** Copied over the seeding file too

====== Lecture Notes ======
* Hackathon on October 16th to work on the midterm presentation from 1-5 in Klaus
* Stocks team coming to join our team to help wiht stocks runs
* For my error on creating the conda environment...
** remove the .git folder (rm -rf .git) since I'm running out of disk space
* Make sure to use conda activate emade before running the code.

====== Personal Exploration ======
* After getting emade set up:
**ssh into pace-ice and allocate a node/start the database. I found that I can start the database by just running mysqld_safe and NOT cd /usr
** qsub -I -q pace-ice -l nodes=1:ppn=1,walltime=01:00:00
** mysqld_safe --datadir='/storage/home/hpaceice1/xliu725/scratch/db'
** module load anaconda3/2020.02
** module load gcc
** conda activate emade (name of the environment)
** mysql -h atl1-1-02-012-5-l
** Create a database in a new terminal after ssh’ing onto the atl-… address with command CREATE DATABASE <name>;
** Later, you can also delete a database if you type DROP DATABASE <name>;
** exit mysql and find the template file. Then use vim input_titanic or something similar to edit
** When editing, the server is the atl… address, the hostname/password are your information, and the database is the name you used when creating the database in the past
** Unfortunately, running into errors when actually running emade using the following commands:
*** python src/GPFramework/launchEMADE.py templates/<input_file>
*** Make sure you use launchEMADE.py and not launchGTMOEP.py as our codebase is just a little different

====== Lecture Notes ======
* Peer evaluations due next week and open on Monday
* Modularity
** Depth is increased but Vincent still has to debug
** Having trouble logging into the sql node, but could only sometimes connect
*** Potential check: SQL might not let us connect based on what node we're connecting from, need to change sql settings
*** Check the accounts that we made with wildcard host, we want user@% host.
*** mysql -h nodename -u username -p
*** Want username to be xliu725, but if we go to the node that we see that logging in locally (localhost), we get two users from two nodes
** 'xliu725'@'%'
** https://docs.pace.gatech.edu/interactiveJobs/interactive_cmd/ (may want an interactive job if we can't ssh)
* Stocks
** Team split up
** EMADE full individuals are a length of list 4
** Various crossovers allow you to cross over multiple individuals
*** Can also crossbreed

====== Subteam Meeting 10/7 ======
* Worked on debugging new PACE-ICE issues
* Bernadette had a potential fix although it didn't work for me
** After setting up a database instance, open up a new terminal to run the following commands
*** qsub -I -q pace-ice -l nodes=1:ppn=1,walltime=01:00:00
*** exit
*** mysql -u root
*** DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user='';
*** GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'USERNAME'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
*** FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

====== Personal Exploration ======
* Focused mostly on reading the paper that Gabriel linked on overleaf.
* Edited and fixed several grammatical mistakes throughout the paper
* Paper summary
** Looking at AutoML methods that can utilize modularity techniques inspired through genetic programming
** Integrate ARLs (Adaptive Representation through Learning) through EMADE and look at datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and stock benchmark
** AutoML will search for the optimal hyper-parameters with little human interaction
* Potential areas of improvement for the paper:
** Improved selection 
*** We weigh individuals with more ARLs as better, but that assumes that ARLs are significantly better. 
***We could try weighing them less and see how little we can weigh them without them disappearing from our individual pool.
** Population Updates
*** Currently talks about introducing new random individuals in generation with genetic duplicates
*** As a note, we may also want to start with a better seeding file as well
*** Why are genetic duplicates needed if we're looking to expand diversity?
* Potential areas to add for the paper:
** Actual depth of ARLs
*** Vincent is currently working on it this semester to have ARLs with more than size 2.
*** Look at how it has different effects on different datasets
** Find the optimal combination of mutation methods, population updates, diversity, etc for the best EMADE ARL model
*** We have many potential avenues to explore and we need to run trials for most of them to determine which perform the best
*** Will different datasets prefer different combinations of the above attributes? And if so, how do we guess which is needed for certain datasets?
** More talk about work done on the titanic dataset? I believe we have a few results in past semesters for that.
*** This could fit under Experiment and also in the introduction to the paper
* Other modifications/potential edits to the paper:
** Need to find old pictures of pareto fronts with super individuals and other things from our past runs for analysis.
*Issues with PACE-ICE
** Currently struggling to get emade installed/set up. It has been ssh'ed over, but I don't have permission to install any packages or create a conda environment.

====== Subteam Meeting 9/25 ======
* Continued to work to set up PACE
** Found out walltime is 8 hours - worried that we can't get long-enough runs
** May transition back to google collab for now
* Bernadette and I managed to connect to our database for a minute before getting kicked out again. Will continue to work on this issue
** Currently working on fixing the MNIST dataset as well
* Vincent is looking into an error in the adf.py codebase that I may try to help debug as well.
* Bernadette managed to merge the stocks team dataset and evaluation functions with our codebase on Vincent's github branch found here: https://github.gatech.edu/vhuang31/emade

====== Personal Exploration ======
* Currently working on setting up the rest of PACE-ICE
** Managed to start an instance of the database but can't verify that it works
** Keep getting error when I run mysql -h atl1-1-02-012-5-l
* Connected for a moment once more but couldn't get it to function continuously
* Working on getting emade into database as well
** Recloned emade from Vincent's branch using git clone
** Working on using SCP to get emade onto pace.
** Code is: scp -r emade xliu725@pace-ice.pace.gatech.edu:~
* Managed to get PACE-ICE and the database working through the following steps:
* Fixed the .my.cnf file through vim by adding in a port number (I choose 3313)
** Terminal 1: qsub -I -q pace-ice -l nodes=1:ppn=1,walltime=01:00:00
** Terminal 1: mysqld_safe --datadir='/storage/home/hpaceice1/xliu725/scratch/db' (do not cd into /usr)
** Terminal 2: ssh atl1-1-02-012-5-1
** Terminal 2: mysql -u root
** Then I ran the SQL commands found on this page: https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/wiki/Guide-to-Using-PACE-ICE

====== Lecture Notes ======
* Things we need to do for the next meeting dealing with images
** Check out our branch
** Make a subfolder for our images
** Change it locally 
** Push changes
* PACE-ICE work
** /storage/home/hpaceice1/shared-classes/materials/vip/AAD
** Numhosts is how many workers are needed to run
** Workers per host is number of subprocesses
* Stocks
** Working on recreating their paper 
* Modularity 
** Currently working on runs with mnist dataset
** Issue with MacBooks trying to unpack files and messing up Google collab
** Look at runs with stocks dataset in the future to see if that works
** Potentially look at Jason’s algorithm when looking at mnist data
** Not enough generations last semester which may have caused our messed up pareto fronts

====== Subteam Meeting 9/23 ======
* Working together to set up PACE-ICE for emade.
** Can't connect to our cluster when we're trying to check the database
** Figured out how to run the database and connect to PACE-ICE

====== Personal Exploration ======
* Working on installing PACE-ICE and getting it set up. Below are the commands that are run and debugging done (link with instructions is at https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade/wiki/Guide-to-Using-PACE-ICE):
** First I ssh'd into pace from terminal
** Created the scratch folder and db folder within scratch
** Had issues with the .my.cnf file and transferring it to pace using SCP
*** Also needed to change the "USERNAME" to "xliu725".
*** Instead, connected to PACE first and used vim to create the .my.cnf folder in the ~ directory by copying and pasting.
** Ran mysql_install_db --datadir=$HOME/scratch/db
** entered the user folder and started local MySQL instance
*** mysqld_safe --datadir='/storage/home/hpaceice1/xliu725/scratch/db'
* However, got stuck on the step where we're trying to check whether the database is working or not. Unsure why the command of mysql -h atl1-1-02-012-5-l won't work.

====== Lecture Notes ======
* Gabe is joining us today!
* Class updates
** In the wiki page, you can link to the files stored otherwise in the notebook.
** Git add/commit/push any images to files under your name and then link to your notebook
** Self-graded notebook rubric is due next week
* Stocks update
** Met to discuss tasking and what the semester will look like, looking at how to write the paper in the future
*** Results from last semester weren't publishable quality yet
*** Uncertain about whether they should build an outline or work on replicating results
*** Jason: Regardless of final results, work is still worth writing up in an article
** Currently thinking about meeting other non-time conflict students to incorporate the stocks team into the paper
** PACE-ICE is up and running once again!
* Modularity
** Contacted Gabe for help (Thanks Gabe :D)
** Need to fork off the code base
** Jason has also streamlined MNIST data if we want to use that
*** Take a look at gen_mnist data set
*** New saved pickle format, with corresponding template file
*** Jason's file uses precision and recall - but we're really far from the original emade branch
** May also need to assess choices we've made when looking for adfs/arls
** These algorithmic decisions could also be changed and experimenced with
*** May want to change hyperparameters or how to use ranking, and how we select arl's could be diversified
** See which parts are arbitrary and can edit in the future
*** Try to make five arl's each generation which can definitely change
** Could also start an exercise of trying to write a paper/potentially have an outline
** Full paper submission date is January 20th for GECCO

====== Subteam Meeting 9/16 ======
* Met up on Thursday to talk about having more runs
** Getting everyone set up on Google Collab again
** Connecting to new database that Bernadette set up for the semester
* Issue with the superindividual last semester
** May need to change our seeding file and find new individuals for it
