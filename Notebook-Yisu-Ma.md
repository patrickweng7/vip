## Week 1: August 25th - September 1st (2021)
### Lecture Overviews
* Summarizing the logistics of the class: wiki page, general ideas, syllabus, notebooks.
* Started lecture on genetic programming.
* Jupyter notebook and lab 1 introduction
### Lecture Notes
* Genetic Algorithms: various evolutionary algorithms to create a solution or best individual.
* Key Words:
  1. Individual: one specific candidate in the population (with properties such as DNA)
  2. Population: a group of individuals whose properties will be altered 
  3. Objective: a value used to characterize individuals that you are trying to maximize or minimize (usually the goal is to increase objective through 
     the evolutionary algorithm)
  4. Fitness: relative comparison to other individuals; how well does the individual accomplish a task relative to the rest of the population? 
  5. Evaluation: a function that computes the objective of an individual
  6. Mate/Crossover: represents mating between individuals
  7. Mutate: introduces random modifications; the purpose is to maintain diversity
* One Max Problem
### Lab 1
**One Max Problem:** try to find a bit string containing all 1s.
