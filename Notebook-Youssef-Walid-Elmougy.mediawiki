* This week's updated Notes from the stocks sub team brainstorming ([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QUhsR4KMv2y8PF5D4O3i9qqwCKDYRBNLA5JrVKLk32M/edit Link to Doc])
** Interesting paper to look at: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324802031_Algorithmic_Financial_Trading_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Time_Series_to_Image_Conversion_Approach Algorithmic Financial Trading with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: Time Series to Image Conversion Approach]
*** The paper shows methods of visualizing TI's in a neural net, we want to apply it to EMADE using modules created by the NLP and NN sub teams
** Extend on the Spring semester's work by focusing on the most useful technical indicators and the best EMADE configuration
** Add fundamental and technical analysis methods to EMADE
** Look at past work in Portfolio Optimization
** Explore Dr. Zutty's feedback:
*** What variables give the best results?
*** Focus on the input data instead of tuning hyperparameters
** Possibly expanding input data to all years between 2008-2020

== April 30, 2021: Final Presentations ==

=== Final Presentations Notes ===
* We had all sub teams present their semesters work!
* Comments from each presentation:
** Stocks:
*** We presented what we've been working on after the midterm presentation, with a wrap up of our semester goals
** EzCGP:
*** At the midterm point, they had removed augmentation and preprocessing, which created high accuracy for training but was low in validation
*** Their goals were to improve ability to visualize genomes, recreate results without relying on transfer learning, and create mating functions for cartesianGP
*** The individuals that were produced from the experiments were matched to the target distributions
*** An accuracy of 68.5% was achieved after 50 generations, which is an improvement compared to 56% with no implementation of primitives
*** Analyzed the paper "Cartesian Genetic Programming Paper" and used 4 objectives from the paper in the experiments
** NLP/NN
*** Used PACE-ICE for experiments because of the GPUs but there were many MySQL errors and long queue times
*** Created documentation in Notion but migrated it into the Wiki and created subpages to explain the primitives and the MqSQL errors and fixes
*** They experimented with the Amazon Product Reviews dataset
*** The metric for complexity was elapsed time for individuals which was used to evaluate
*** The mean AUC is less than the seeded AUC
*** The models need to be more detailed and sophisticated to deal with longer reviews and more complex data
** Modularity
*** The overall team objective is to explore ways to abstract parts of individuals, which creates building blocks through ARL
*** Their goal is to increase the complexity of the ARL
*** Experiment used titanic dataset with feature data, and MNIST dataset with stream data
*** Evaluation objectives used were Precision, Cohen Kappa Score, F1, Recall, Accuracy
*** They will change the seeding file for individuals in the MNIST dataset, results: 30 seeded individuals with F1 and accuracy score less than 0.1

== April 19, 2021: Week 13 ==

=== Lecture Notes ===
* Discussed the effect of window size
** We still haven't used a bigger dataset so it seems good to increase the window size to 40 (from 30) and gradually increase it when we implement a bigger dataset
* EMADE run started, joined as a worker!
** Window size = 40
** Same evaluation functions
** Addition of the CDF
** The result was good, one individual was very simple (used one TI, MyBollingerBand) but still performed very good compared to the last run
* Datasets added:
** XLP was added
** S&P 500 Short was added
* Technical Indicators:
** Fibonacci TI was implemented in EMADE code on GitHub
** I found these that were useful and will be implemented to be used in the next runs if possible:
*** Delta Volume - it shows the total amount of transactions occurring on both the bid and the ask in an interval ([https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/xtrader-help/x-study/technical-indicator-definitions/volume-delta-vol/ Vol ∆])
*** Volume on the Ask ([https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/xtrader-help/x-study/technical-indicator-definitions/volume-on-the-ask-avol/ AVOL])
*** Bid Volume ([https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/xtrader-help/x-study/technical-indicator-definitions/bid-volume-bvol/ BVOL])
* Task: evaluate which TI's are the most common for the best performing individuals, research more volume-data based TI's, help with the CDF

== April 12, 2021: Week 12 ==

=== Lecture Notes ===
* I suggested to expand the scope of our results to improve our individuals' performance by adding other datasets to the folds in EMADE
** My idea: S&P 500 dataset
** Other ideas: XLP, ETFs in the range of 2010-2019
* The individual that was run with a Monte-Carlo random distribution was evaluated and we saw visualizations of the performance
* New evaluation function:
** Use the normal CDF of a profit from an individual compared to the closest random experiment result
* A run is planned next week, plan to join as a worker:
* I worked on researching more volume-based TI's
** My TI's:
*** Money Flow Index - it uses price and volume in order to identify overbought and oversold conditions of a stock. Its also used to spot divergences in which a trend in price might change ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mfi.asp MFI])
*** Volume Price Trend - consists of a cumulative volume line that adds or subtracts a multiple of the percentage change in a share price’s trend and current volume, depending upon the stock's upward or downward movements ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vptindicator.asp VPT])
** Other teammates TI's:
*** Fibonacci Indicator
*** Stochastic RSI
*** Beta
*** Aroon
*** Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)
*** Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
* Task: join EMADE run when started, continue researching TI's, and do literature review on improvements to the current implementation

=== Lecture Notes ===
* Dr. Zutty gave a Stats lecture during the main meeting
** Very helpful for the Stocks team
** Our idea is to try out the Welch's test on individuals' profit percentage on various stocks
* Discussed new fitness functions to optimize
** Maximize Average Profit per Transaction
** Minimize Variance of Profit per Transaction
** (Individual Profit Percentage) - (Profit from Buy-and-Hold)
** A function that determines how close the buy and sell points are to the nearest local maximum and minimum points
* We ran a new EMADE run, joined in as a worker!
* From the data there wasn't a big performance jump
** Discussed that we can compute the z-score of an individuals' profit percentage instead of using the profit percentage evaluation function, this will help EMADE be unbiased
* Found another link that would be helpful for finding TI's 
** [https://trading-education.com/20-technical-indicators-used-by-trading-gurus 20 Types Of Technical Indicators Used By Trading Gurus]
* Tasks: join as worker on EMADE run, look through results in the database, start on tasks for new small sub-team
** Read other papers that give ideas of the TI's, smoothing functions, and evaluation functions that can be used

=== Lecture Notes ===
* Abhiram and Max completed the implementation of TA-Lib
** They are running some tests to fix bugs as they come up
* The goal is to have another run of EMADE while using the implemented TI's and TA-Lib
* We did some queries of the database to analyze individuals
* Abhiram created a [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KIkFOwujn40HQH9y-SRVjWdLt03mrTGsESFNrLIzvFQ/edit?usp=sharing presentation] that helped us have a better understanding of the Stocks team's EMADE implementation
* I found a list of volume data based TI's that will be useful
** [https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/xtrader-help/x-study/technical-indicator-definitions/list-of-technical-indicators/ List of Technical Indicators]
* I researched more about the following TI's and will be discussing it with the subgroup:
** Parabolic Start and Reverse - it is used to determine the price direction of a stock and indicate when the price direction is changing ([https://www.investopedia.com/trading/introduction-to-parabolic-sar/ Parabolic SAR])
** T3 Moving Average - it gives an early entry with less false signals, has less lag with price data and gives a moving average with more smoothing than the EMA ([https://www.technicalindicators.net/indicators-technical-analysis/150-t3-moving-average T3])
* Task: help debug TA-Lib, continue thinking of fitness functions, and research more volume-based TI's

=== Lecture Notes ===
* Midterm presentation for all sub teams and bootcamp teams. Link to Stocks [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xvS6nfHNZ9N56m4cDXoD4KzHeRoKkhfhsfIDHpysOUE/edit?usp=sharing presentation]
** Completed TI slides
* Dr. Zutty mentioned a couple takeaways:
** We need to increase the evolvability of EMADE individuals, which can be done by reducing the areas that EMADE can error out
*** Most important place to focus on is TI implementations and have a set of check statements
** Can test out using Monte Carlo algorithm in comparing the individuals
*** This will decide on the buy or sell decisions randomly and then compare the profit with the EMADE individual
*** Because of the high variance we decided that instead we should compare it with a buy-and-hold scenario
* Subteam discussed using new fitness functions in EMADE:
** Maximize Average Profit per Transaction
** Minimize Variance of Profit per Transaction
** (Individual Profit Percentage) - (Profit from Buy-and-Hold)
** # of transactions and MAE were not considered
* Tasks: think of more fitness functions and get more TI's

== March 8, 2021: Week 7 ==

=== Lecture Notes ===
* The subteam had a lot of discussion about the profit calculations as the paper included tax and transaction cost
** We decided not to include tax or transaction cost to keep it a simple profit calculation
* I looked into TA-Lib and I'm working on merging the library's TI's into our EMADE file
** I'm still researching more volume data TI's
* EMADE run was started on Friday
** Run lasted for 30 generations in 4 hours and created only 2 valid individuals, none were seeded individuals
** The results will be discussed in our next subteam meeting 
** Looking on making the following changes:
*** Decrease population size to ~60/generation
*** Decrease mutation probabilities
*** Look at the effects from STREAM_TO_FEATURES
** Tasks: continue with volume data TI's and connect as a worker on the EMADE run

== December 2, 2020: Final Presentations ==

=== Final Presentations Notes ===
* Listened to the following subteam presentations:
** Stocks Subteam
*** There was a lot of inconsistencies with the research paper data in the calculations of the trading signals
*** Explored a novel method to develop trading labels using a genetic algorithm based oracle
**** Instead of optimizing for overall profit, a new fitness function was created to optimize the profit for a specific time window
**** Mean difference for optimizing for overall profit was considerably higher than the new fitness function
*** Technical Indicator primitives used in EMADE: SMA, EMA, MACD, KD%, RSI, R%, EOM, OBV, Bollinger Bands, CCI, MFI
*** Future work: working to find new literature benchmarks and compare the current results on their datasets / with their labels
** NLP Subteam
*** Evolutionary neural network for deep learning using EMADE
*** Datasets used: Toxicity dataset, Chest X-ray dataset, WikiDetox dataset, Amazon Product Reviews dataset
*** Created a new primitive to be considered when creating an individual: BERTInputLayer in the DistilBERT [Input]Layer
*** Higher level idea: reduce mutations of good individuals and increase mutations of bad individuals, implemented an Adaptive Mutation Function with changing mutation probability
*** Successfully ran local style runs on PACE with CUDA-enabled GPUs
*** New CV primitives added: Adaptive Mean Thresholding, Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding, Otsu's Binarization (2D)
*** The evolution did not help find better models
**** EMADE was only making the smallest networks possible, optimizing for having as few parameters as possible
*** Future work: working with more datasets, will be trying out coevolution and implementing multi task learning and more complex adaptive mutation schemes
** EZGCP Subteam
*** Used OpenCV primitives
**** Previously used Accuracy and F1 score for objective scores, but now use Precision and Recall because it reflects a more accurate score for the output
*** Runs utilize PACE-ICE GPU with 2 GPUs (total run time is 8 hours)
*** Genome seeding by saving 20 individuals after each generations as pickle files to be used as warm starts in future runs
*** Dataset used: CIFAR10 dataset
**** SOTA accuracy on dataset: 99.7%, ResNet accuracy on dataset: 93%
*** Future work: experiment on block structure, continue neural architecture search experiment, and integrate EZCGP with EMADE
** Modularity Subteam
*** Exploring wats to abstract parts of individuals, allowing for the creation of building blocks that can help with the genetic process
*** Dataset used: Titanic dataset
**** Objectives of FP and FN
*** Experiments: Differential Fitness, Alternative Selection, Data Pair Restriction, Alternate Selection Updated
**** Compared No ARL vs experiment AUC
**** Multiple experiments show significance in generations 10-20
*** Future work: experiments with MNIST dataset, integrating ARLs & ADFs, selection heuristics

== November 30, 2020: Week 16 ==

=== Subteam Meeting Notes ===
* Had a meeting with Anjana and Aryaan regarding Technical Indicators
* We picked the following TI's to use in EMADE:
** Bollinger Bands - Set of momentum indicators which consist of a simple moving average (middle band), an upper band, and a lower band
** CCI - Momentum based indicator that determines the market trends and volume by measuring the current price level relative to the average price level over a period of time
** MFI - Both a momentum and volume based indicator that measures the flow of money into and out of a security/index over a period of time
* These 3 indicators were part of the most common TI's used in stock trading from the resources read last week, all other TI's have already been coded by previous teams
* I wrote code for the CCI TI to be implemented in EMADE
* Anjana, Aryaan, and I wrote code for the Bollinger Bands TI to be implemented in EMADE, code snippet:

<div><ul> 
<li style="display: inline-block;"> [[files/ BBTI.png |thumb|none|500px|Bollinger Bands TI]] </li>
</ul></div>

* Task: document the CCI TI on the "Developing Technical Indicator primitives" slide for Wednesday's presentation

=== Subteam Meeting Notes ===
* Dr. Zutty pointed the team to look further into specific trees to understand the trends in the data
* Looked further into the formulas used for the data in the research paper but was unsuccessful into finding one base formula
** I personally emailed the authors of the paper to learn more about the techniques used but received no reply, will be looking into other options
* The team's AWS server had a ransomware attack and the data was deleted
** A new AWS server was created and a new EMADE run using S&P 500 data with pre-calculated Technical Indicators was started
*** Attempted to join the run as a worker process but ran into some configuration issues that I am looking into to find a fix
* Still researching Technical Indicators:
** I understand the meaning and use of Technical Indicators but still need to find useful ones for stock trading
** Will work with other first semester students to have a specific direction to look into
* Useful resources for Technical Indicators:

** Dr. Zutty mentioned that the Pareto Front graph AUC may be incorrect because we did not include the extremity points (0,1) and (1,0) for both MOGP and EMADE, which may have wrongly skewed the results

=== Highlights from Group Presentation ===
* I worked on the Pareto Front graphs included in last week's record
* I handled designing the final EMADE evolutionary algorithm with the following results:
** Number of generations: 28
** Number of individuals in database: 6066

'''Using the Kaggle Titanic Data Set:'''
* Team mates: Steven, Chris, Weiyao
* There were a couple of initial observations and cleaning on the dataset:
** The only columns with missing entries are "Age", "Cabin", and "Embarked"
*** Cabin has 687/891 entries missing so its redundant to have in our program - dropped the column
*** Age has 177/891 entries missing - filled it up using the mean age
*** Embarked has 2/891 entries missing - filled it up using the most common option
*** Name and Ticket don't have missing entries but it doesn't have a huge correlation to the survival rate - dropped the column
** Made PassengerID the index
** Embarked and Sex columns were not in <code> int64</code> so we converted the different options to <code> 0, 1, 2 </code>
* Split up the training set to be 70% and the testing set to be 30%

'''Multiple Objects in GA and GP:'''
* Gene pool - the set of genome to be evaluated during the current generation
** Genome (genotypic description of individuals):
*** GA = set of values
*** GP = tree structure, string
** Search space (set of possible genome):
*** For AAD - set of all possible algorithms

* Objective space - the set of objectives
** Objectives = set of measurements each genome is scored against
** Evaluation - maps a genome/individual
*** From a location in search space (genotypic description)
*** To a location in objective space (phenotype description)

* Classification Measures, The Confusion Matrix:

{| class="wikitable"
!
!Predicted Positive
!Predicted Negative
|-
|Actual Positive (P)
|True Positive (TP)
|False Negative (FN)
|-
|Actual Negative (N)
|False Positive (FP)
|True Negative (TN)
|}

* where:
** False Positive (FP) - Type I Error
** False Negative (FN) - Type II Error

* Maximisation Measures:
** Sensitivity or True Positive Rate (TPR) (AKA hit rate or recall) = TP/P = TP/(TP+FN)
** Specificity (SPC) or True Negative Rate (TPR) = TN/N = TN/(TN+FP)

* Minimisation Measures:
** False Negative Rate (FNR) = FN/P = FN/(TP+FN) = 1 - TPR
** Fallout or False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP/N = TN/(FP+TN)  OR  = 1 - TNR = 1 - SPC

* Other Measures:
** Precision or Positive Predictive Value (PPV) = TP/(TP+FP) [bigger is better]
** False Discovery Rate (FDR) = FP/(TP+FP)  OR  = 1 - PPV [smaller is better]
** Negative Predictive Value (NPV) = TN/(TN+FN) [bigger is better]
** Accuracy (ACC) = (TP+TN)/(P+N)  OR  = (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN) [bigger is better]

* Pareto Optimality - An individual is Pareto if there is no other individual in the population that outperforms the individuals on all objectives
** Pareto Frontier = set of all Pareto individuals
** Drive selection by favoring Pareto individuals (but also maintaining diversity)
** 2 Algorithms:
*** Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II):
**** Population separated by nondomination ranks and individuals are selected by a binary tournament 
**** Lower Pareto ranks beat higher ranks
*** Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA 2):
**** Individuals are separated using their “strength” and “rank”

=== Lab 2 - Genetic Programming and Multi-Objective Optimization (PART 2)===
'''Symbolic Regression:'''
* This uses the technique of Pareto optimality
* The process of evolution pushes to optimize on all objectives
* To measure the performance of the Pareto Front, the area under the curve (AUC) is used
** The lower the AUC, the better the Pareto Front
* Task - edit the implementation to produce at least a 25% decrease in the AUC:
** I tried 2 different changes to the implementation:
*** Let the primitive set only contain trigonometry primitives (sin, cos, tan)
**** This decreased the AUC to 1.0982901691790425
*** Let the primitive set only contain basic operation primitives (add, subtract, multiply, negative)
**** This decreased the AUC to 0.6912744703006891

== August 26, 2020: Week 2 AAD Bootcamp ==

=== Lecture Notes ===
* Similar to GA, although now the individual is the function itself instead of having an evaluator to obtain objective scores
* The program is represented as a tree structure:
** tree '''Nodes''' are called '''Primitives''' which represent functions
** tree '''Leaves''' are called '''Terminals''' which represent parameters
** Input = particular type of terminal
** Output = f(x) produced at the root
* The tree structure is stored as a '''lisp preordered parse tree''' (operator followed by inputs)
** E.g. Tree for f(x)=3*4+1 is [+, *, 3, 4, 1]
* New tree generation in GP can be done through:
# Crossover - by exchanging subtrees at a random point in each tree
# Mutation - by either inserting, deleting, or changing a node or subtree

=== Lab 2 - Genetic Programming and Multi-Objective Optimization (PART 1)===
'''Symbolic Regression:'''
* This was a good crossover between DEAP's PrimitiveTree class and genetic programming
* I was able to add more primitives in the code (although some caused the creation of invalid data due to invalid operations at specific generations)

=== Lecture Notes ===
* Genetic Algorithms - creating a new generation through the process of mating/mutation of individuals, until producing the most fit individual.
* Algorithm flow process:
# Randomly initialize population
# Determine fitness of population
# Repeat steps until most fit individual cannot get any better:
## Select parents from population
## Perform crossover(mating) on parents creating population
## Perform mutation of population
## Determine fitness of population

=== Lab 1 - Genetic Algorithms with DEAP ===
* Read through DEAP [https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/basic/part1.html documentation] and [https://towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-evolutionary-computation-using-deap-618ca974b8cb walkthrough]
* Installed DEAP Python Library using <code>pip install deap</code>
* Opened lab using <code>jupyter notebook</code>

'''One Max Problem:'''
* The objective is to find a bit string containing all 1s with a set length. The Max. fitness possible is 100.0 (maximizing objective). The algorithm is run for 40 generations.
* Ran <code>main</code> code 3 times, producing different results:
** Run 1 - reached Max. fitness on Generation 30.
** Run 2 - reached Max. fitness on Generation 38.
** Run 3 - did not reach Max. fitness. Fitness on Generation 39 was 99.0. This can be caused due to: the randomly initialized population, probability of occurrences of mating and mutating, and the probability of flipping a bit when an individual is mutated.

'''The N Queens Problem:'''
* This problem creates a configuration of n queens where each queen is assigned to one column, and only one queen can be on each line. The Min. fitness possible is 0.0 (minimizing objective). The algorithm is run for 100 generations.
* Ran <code>main</code> code 3 times, producing different results (n=20):
** Run 1 - did not reach global minimum. Global Min. on Generation 99 was 1.0.
** Run 2 - reached global minimum on Generation 25.
** Run 3 - reached global minimum on Generation 20.
* The following are plots of the average, minimum, and maximum over 100 generations for different values of n:
