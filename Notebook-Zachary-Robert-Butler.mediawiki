'''Progress Notes:'''
*Completed One Max problem.
**Was based around randomizing a population of 300, creating 40 generations of children, and seeing if we could maximize fitness
**Ran 15 times, didn't get a final generation without a maximized individual (but understand it can occur)
*Completed N Queens problem.
**Was based around placing queens randomly on a chess board and attempting to mutate children generations to have a board of no conflicts
**My method was to randomly move columns to the front or the back, shown here: 
    def myMutation(individual, indpb):
       for i in range(size):
           if random.random() < indpb:
               backFront = random.randint(0,1)
               if backFront = 0:
                   individual[i], individual[0] = \
                       individual[0], individual[i]
               else:
                   individual[i], individual[size-1] = \
                       individual[0], individual[size-1]
            
       return individual

**Based on the observation of the graphs, it looks like my mutation method performed better than the one given (not sure how to embed pictures...)
**I am confused on what parameters/functions to tweak, however increasing mutation probability improved the algorithm very much

== January 14, 2019 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Had our second meeting where we got to hear about specific sub-teams, as well as learning more about Genetic Algorithms
** Learned about tree structure of genomes in Genetic Programming
** Learned how symbolic regression worked and how we would implement an objective to compare

'''Progress Notes:'''
Symbolic Regression portion of Lab 2
*Attempted to evolve an algorithm to reach what looks like an x^4 function
*This is a run using the given mutation, and without my added primitives:
[[files/SuccessfulRun1.png]]
*This is a run using my mutation (mutShrink, which randomly shrinks a branch and replaces it with one of it's arguments)
[[files/SuccessfulRun2.png]]
*This is a run using my added primitives (which were mod and reciprocal)
**There is clearly some error here, my assumption is that because mod is not a basic function like addition and subtraction, it heavily skews the population and ruins future individual performance
**While the best individual actually did have a decent performance (1.256e-16), the average score was infinity, so clearly something was wrong with the primitives I added

'''Progress Notes:'''
*Completed Lab 2 Part 2
**Attempted to minimize two objectives, the error and the size of the tree
**Used Pareto dominance to determine better individuals
**Area Under Curve was around 3.3 on average , 2.384 in this picture:
[[files/paretorun1.png]]
**My attempt at "improving" the algorithm was to change the mutator method; from mutUniform to mutShrink
***My thought process behind this change was that because one of our objectives was minimizing tree size, a mutator that decreased tree size would be good.
***While this change gave a much smaller AUC, about ~.7, it also gave us much less pareto individuals, with a run having .34 AUC pictured here: 
[[files/paretorun2.png]]
*The main thing I learned was that it is hard to determine the optimal objective minimization, because as tree size decreased, mean squared error increased, signalling that it is hard to determine the true "best" way to optimize and algorithm

*Completed my portion of Titanic problem
**My team was attempting to use different types of classifiers, I used AdaBoost because it seemed like an interesting estimator because it uses another classifier to fit copies of itself around the same dataset, but with different weights
**Unfortunately it didn't do too well when using different base_estimators, having the best score with the default decision stump
**Here is a small snippet of my code:
   ada_clf = ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier(random_state = 0, n_estimators = 50, algorithm = 'SAMME.R')
   ada_clf.fit(X_train.values, y_train.values)
   print(ada_clf.score(X_test.values, y_test.values))

 [ 25  79]]

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* This was a meeting between the model implementation group (Sean, Yoonwoo, Jiseok, and myself)
* While we initially planned to code from 6pm-midnight, we encountered numerous problems and ended up completing around 7am :(
* What we were able to get done:
** Finished up code for LSTM, which easily allowed us to add RNN and MLP since they're all very similar
** Unsuccessfully troubleshot my RBFN code 
*** The problem with this was that I had to create an actual Keras Layer class, rather than adding premade layers to the KerasRegressor, which turned out to be an issue since none of us had experience with doing so. Hopefully we'll be able to figure it out sometime next year if we stay within the stocks team.
** Fixed some of the unfinished data-parsing/preprocessing code
** Successfully ran all learners locally on our machines
** We ran into some memory problems we had previously encountered again, so after fixing them we began an EMADE run at about 7am
== April 21, 2019 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Had a team meeting to create and go over our presentation for Monday
** Unfortunately, we had massive timeouts with our ML models, even when 1. they ran perfectly fine locally and 2. we reduced the epochs significantly. We attempted to remedy this to no avail, and weren't able to get any EMADE results
*** To semi-resolve that issue, we simulated runs with our stats/ML models to get some performance data, such as their error and their expected profit when run on our data.
** Finished splitting up who would present what and explaining some of the information to less experienced team members
== April 22, 2019 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Presentation Day
** Overall I was pleased with our presentation, while some subteam members didn't seem familiar with what they were presenting, it went well.
** We obviously had issues because we never got an EMADE run, but will be improving accordingly come next semester
*** Our two biggest issues were: 1. not running EMADE every time we implemented a new learner, to make sure they worked, and 2. not starting implementation/running early so we could fix any errors
* Our only tasking is to complete the notebook by Thursday morning, April 25.

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Final Presentation day
** Everything went well, our presentation was a lot more thorough because not only did we now have two primitives, but we finally had EMADE results
** I covered most of the stemmatizing content and reviewed what it did and how we made it a very flexible primitive
*** We allowed for different stemming/lemmatization methods to be used, as well as want to include the ability to change vectorization/learning capabilities
** Bek covered our sentiment primitive, which has the ability to convert the input to sentimental values based on sentence, word, or n-gram vectorization.
** Reagan covered the bulk of our EMADE output
*** We got decent results, and while the "best" individuals on both of our datasets didn't include our primitives, it was promising because our stemmatizer primitive was in an individual that also performed extremely well
** We basically concluded that with more time spent solely on one dataset, optimizing our stemmatization and sentiment primitives to said dataset, we would've gotten better results, but overall we're very happy with the final product.

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* First meeting of the semester for time conflict
* Went over some basic statistics/probability review
** Specifically went over t-statistic tests and how they work/what to implement
* Were tasked with thinking of a couple t-tests to run over the semester/create for our previous data
** Possible: Stemming, lemmatization, best performing lemmatizer, sentiment, changing vectorization method

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Check in meeting about any updates/news with our teams
** I haven't been in contact with Reagan/Bek too much so I need to confirm what they're working on so I can find out what to work on myself
** Other than that, we talked about splitting into groups so we could work independently from main group 
*** I believe NLP will be staying together

== January 24, 2020 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Missed this meeting but caught up with Reagan about our whereabouts
** The regular NLP team is going to remain focused on getting EMADE running, while time-conflict is focusing on getting PACE-ICE running
** Essentially everyone is going to try to get EMADE working on PACE-ICE

== January 31, 2020 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Started setting up PACE-ICE
** Having weird connectivity issues from both on and off campus
** Essentially doing a fresh anaconda install, setting up an environment and getting MySQL running alongside EMADE

* Met up with Anuraag, Alex, and Reagan to try to setup MySQL and get EMADE running
** Was able to get MySQL setup
** Tested queueing jobs and running MySQL queries, all of which seemed to be working
** Next going to focus on getting EMADE 
** Trying to setup Git LFS and get Titanic running on EMADE

== February 14, 2020 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Talked about updates/moving forward, still trying to get PACE-ICE setup running EMADE
** Want to have a backup in case we decide PACE is useless/too much work
** Currently working on actually running EMADE with Titanic/testing runs of EMADE
*** Might have to use Git LFS to download rather than cloning
** Trying to either get MySQL 5.7 on PACE, or setup the backup running on Google cloud

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* My computer has broken twice in the past 2 weeks so I haven't made much progress since I have had to redownload everything twice!
* Have been working on running UnitTests with EMADE
** Created some preliminary unit tests to test old text_processing stuff and started to get runs going
** Have had to download a bunch of dependencies and get EMADE up and running
* My plans for the week or two are work with Reagan and Alex on working to get EMADE running, just so we can move forward with testing everything.
* Right now I'm focused on getting the MySQL version running on PACE-ICE

'''Meeting Notes:'''

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Hackathon Day
* We began work on our presentation
** Great timing: PACE is being shutdown for the weekend, so we won't be able to get anything today :(
** Focused on presentation and trying to get preliminary tests so we can start to run as soon as possible
** In terms of team tasking, it looks like everyone has EMADE running and getting through UnitTests, Alex may have just gotten MySQL running, and were all waiting to be able to connect via said worker nodes once he gives us his qsub file/configurations.
** We are basically in limbo until PACE is back up

== March 6, 2020 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Naturally, now that PACE is back up, it completely wiped all of our configurations/environmental variables, AND changed the MySQL versioning
** This is *great* news for us because now we have more issues to fix before we can get runs going
** We've tasked Alex with trying to fix these because he seems to have the most experience with it
** I'm going to begin looking into statistical tests we can implement to measure the performance of our primitives/individuals
*** This will likely be tasking for the new semester students as they have some experience with it (AUC) and it's easy to get into

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Presentation Day
** Went well, although my slides were the Statistical Test and New Student Slides which ended up being rather useless since time-conflict doesn't get any/many new students
** Obviously we wish we had results from runs, but hopefully with PACE almost being setup we'll be able to get long runs and tests for the final presentation come April
** Since we won't have new students for running statistical tests, I'll probably be the one creating/running/plotting the tests, which is what I'll start to look into and maybe get some preliminary stuff written for over break

== March 27, 2020 ==
'''Meeting Notes:'''
* I missed this meeting because I didn't realize we had meetings during the "testing" week of remote instruction
** Touched base with Alex who suggested I start to look into specific implementation of stats tests from our returned fitness data
** I'm also aware all of our PACE data got wiped, and people are gonna have to re-setup everything
** This means I may instead just focus on stats tests rather than getting EMADE running again, and let the others get actual runs

* It looks like the biggest issue right now is the jobs are running without getting canceled but aren't outputting anything, which I'm trying to help look into

* Finally had a real check-in with the team and was able to get updated on what output we're getting
* It looks like most people are getting runs going with EMADE and we're getting actual results
* We're returning the fitnesses of 4 objectives using the input_summaries.xml template: (false_positives, false_negatives, accuracy, num_elements)
** Alex wants me to pull fitnesses and get some statistical info on these returns 
** I'm going to look into what the old vis team did and see if I can use anything, I don't really know anything about them but I remembered they had some ...vis stuff so I figure it's not a bad place to look
** Also just going to start looking into specifically what info I can pull from those specific objectives

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* I've been having a couple issues with the previous output they gave me:
** We currently only have one valid individual, that shows up randomly in generations. All of the other fitnesses are (inf, inf, inf, inf), and thus unusable
** It's hard to do anything without knowing the true_positives/true_negatives. I can't get AUC (because I need True Positive Rate) or F1 score or anything with it, which is telling me that the best thing I can use is our accuracy score, which is 1 - true_accuracy.
*** I've asked to see if we can edit and return more fitnesses, but it seems like everyone is working on their own problems, so I think I'm going to have to deal with just this and figure out what to do from there
** I'm going to look into the valid individuals with Alex, and also start to write the code for the stats tests, just my own script to parse through our output files

'''Meeting Notes:'''
* Final presentation day
** I was able to help Alex fix our multi-dimensional problem by looking into creating a multi-dimensional classifier (just so our 3D data would work properly)
** We were able to get it working for SVC and Bayes, and used those in our runs
** As I previously realized, I wouldn't be able to get much in terms of "real" ML performance metrics, so I just wrote some code to get information both by generation and for all generations up to the Nth generation
[[files/Statstrends.png]]
** Other than that I picked out some interesting individuals by accuracy_score; the pareto individuals were unfortunately just the multi-dimensional classifiers, but some more complex trees had the same accuracies
** I also did some basic stats like max/min/mean/std on all of our fitnesses, which yielded some informational but rather boring results
** In the future I'm hoping to be more proactive with either getting EMADE running myself or with the other members on the team, so I can get the output necessary to get the results I want. I'm disappointed I couldn't dive deeper into performance metrics, but I guess it's an area to improve in.
** Overall the presentation went well! There were some questions about the wording of my graphs, which is understandable because to be honest I don't know how to properly word them without being verbose, but both the slides I wrote and the rest of the teams presentation were good
