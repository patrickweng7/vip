Week 1 (1/06/20 - 1/10/20):
* We introduced ourselves to the class and discussed the different types of sub-teams.  
* I am interested in The Artificial Nest sub-team. I believe I can contribute best to this team with my background in environmental engineering courses I have taken so far. 
Week 2 (1/13/20 - 1/17/20):
* We introduced ourselves again to the class. I also spoke with Stephen and officially joined The Artificial Nest sub-team. We will try to meet every Thursday in the evenings.
Week 3 (1/20/20 - 1/24/20):
* We did not have a full team meeting this week, but Stephen and I had a sub-team meeting on Thursday to discuss the background I need to know before we delve deeper into constructing artificial nests. We have ordered thick card stock to use and test its ability to withstand moisture.
Week 4 (1/27/20 - 1/31/20):
* Every group met today (1/27/20) to discuss their current progress.
* Stephen and I ordered bee tubes and also ordered thick construction paper in order to make our own bee tubes that are able to easily place holes in or unroll to see where the bees have laid eggs and how many eggs have been laid. The main issue is finding a material that is thick enough to withstand moisture but also easy to poke holes through or unroll.
Week 5 (2/03/20 - 2/07/20):
* Whole Team meeting today (2/03/20), every group discussed their current progress.
*We debated between using a material called phragmite due to its cheap cost but multiple benefits as a bee tube (easy to open), but we decided to stick with card stock due to its easy access on campus and affordability.
Week 6 (2/10/20 - 2/14/20)
* This week we began rolling our card stock tubes. We decided to test the strengths of different types of adhesive: gorilla glue and a washable glue stick. We rolled multiple rolls with each type of glue. We found that the glue stick was unable to hold the card stock so we immediately threw it out and continued with the gorilla glue. The gorilla glue rolled tube also held together strongly when placed under running sink water for 15 seconds, assuring us that it will not fall apart when placed in a possibly wet environment.
* Zephren also joined our group this week, making us a three person team.
Week 7 (2/17/20 - 2/21/20)
* We began drilling varying amounts of holes in different blocks of wood. We tested blocks with 8, 15 and 21 holes, all currently 3/8 of an inch in diameter. We decided to go with the intermediate because it is less crowded but also uses an adequate amount of space. We plan to drill more wooden blocks this week but with varying hole sizes to experiment and see what size and spacing the bees prefer.
* We also are planning to fly the drone once the weather clears up.
Week 8 (2/24/20 - 2/28/20)
* We have drilled 4 blocks for each hole size (3/8th, 1/4th and 1/2 of an inch) and we have began rolling paper for each size except the 1/4th holes because that will make it too tight for the bees to fit in it. We want to purchase a type of PVC roller from Home Depot to help us roll the tubes faster and more efficiently. 
* We plan to place these outside by March 1st. We will most likely distribute them all over campus to have more diverse results. We are planning on outside Kendeda and outside the Architecture building as of right now.
Week 9 (3/2/20 - 3/6/20)
* Behind schedule as we have yet to deploy the nests due to weather conditions. This has given us more time to evaluate placement locations of the nests. One new place we've discovered is the forested walkway behind Mason that leads to West Campus.
* We have decided to create a post like structure to elevate the nests higher above the ground. Doing this, we need to buy wooden posts, cut them about 4 feet tall, drill holes and zip tie the nests to them.
Week 10 (3/9/20 - 3/13/20)
* We have finally constructed our posts and attached the bee hives. Zephren and I went to the wood shop to cut the long pieces of wood into roughly 4 feet tall pieces and also drilled holes into them where the zip ties will go through. 
* We have also finally deployed our first group of nests. We placed them off the path of the forested walkway behind the MRDC as they will not be disturbed by people or construction here. We will observe this locations popularity with the bee community as the semester goes on and as we continue to place more nests in other locations.
Week 11 (3/16/20 - 3/20/20)
* SPRING BREAK
Week 12 (3/23/20 - 3/27/20)
* Due to Corona extending Spring Break and closing campus, Dr. Leavey has taken home the remainder of our nests that we were unable to deploy before Spring Break. I went back to campus on 3/26 to check on the 4 groups of nests placed behind the MRDC. There was very little bee activity observed. I believe that it is due to the fact that these nests are hidden by trees where many bees are not usually found. It could also possibly be due to the weather variation this week and the shade around the nests resulting in less than ideal temperatures for the bees.
* We are working on figuring out how to work remotely and continue our studies from home by creating a certain amount of nests per person and deploying them ourselves.
Week 13 (3/30/20 - 4/3/20)
* We are working on buildings our own nests, 4 per person, and deploying them ourselves as to abide by the rules of quarantine. We will also rely on Dr. Leavey to update us on our nests that she has deployed at her home. We will take into account the surrounding location, temperature and plant life around our nests when comparing data.
Week 14 (4/6/20 - 4/10/20)
* After consulting with Dr. Leavey, we agreed that with all the quarantine isolation rules it would be best to just work with what we had on hand in our homes. Zephren was the only one who had blocks of wood on hand so he hand drilled 4 new nests and planted them in a garden and will follow up with observations.
* Dr. Leavey updated us on our nests and shows us that a few holes were already being used by the bees at her house. This means our nest design was liked by the bees so we should continue with it and work on enhancing it or also experiment more with it. An idea would be to try different size holes (mostly larger) and also become more efficient in paper rolling as to maximize space within each hole for easy accessibility for the bees.

Week 15 (4/20/20 - 4/24/20)
* Last class of the semester, we presented our final poster that discussed all the research and efforts we made towards the search for the perfect artificial nest.
* Our poster discussed our semester work such as taking the prototypes from last semester and making real models with varying features.
* We are happy with the product we have produced and cannot wait to enhance it in the fall and hopefully get to build the PVC nest prototype to compare to our wooden nest and learn more about the native bee species we are trying to attract while doing so.
