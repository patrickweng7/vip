== Directions ==
See '''[[Example Notebook]]''' for an example of an entry. The three headings for each week should be Team Notes, Sub-team Notes, and Action Items. 

=== Usability ===
The number one consideration for a notebooks is usability. Will your VIP notebook be of use to people who join the team later and need to refer to it? This includes legibility, intelligible technical and meeting notes, and overall organization. Does the notebook contain detailed design notes, design decisions, copies of or pointers to code that you wrote, records of important websites, etc.?

=== Team Notes ===
Team notes should include any team level or cross sub-team activities.  This should include notes from larger group presentations, or administrative notes from class.

=== Sub-Team Notes ===
Sub-team notes should include notes related to your specific sub-team.  Feel free to contain pointers to your code progress in GitHub.  Also feel free to include pictures from whiteboards or drawings, links to important web-sites, or wiki-articles developed that further capture the thought processes from yourself and your group.

=== Action Items ===
The action item table includes columns for the following:
* Task description
* Current status - To be updated weekly until action item is resolved
* Date Assigned 
* Suspense Date - Date action items is to be completed
* Resolved Date - Date the date the action items is completed
Once actions items are resolved, they no longer need copied to the following week. An example table can be copied from the '''[[Example Notebook]].'''

== Individual Notebooks ==
The following are pointers to your to be created notebooks.  Your sub-team will be filled out as you join a team.
