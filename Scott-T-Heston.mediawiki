About Me:
I'm very excited to be working on general research that pushes the boundaries of what is possible computationally. I enjoy the overlap between the ISyE department's intense speciality in optimization and the CS department's (less extraordinary) focus on AI. I plan to pursue a PhD in computational medicine after graduation, and hope that this serves as an area of cross-polinization for the lab. 

Things to Talk to Me About: 
I love linguistics! (And I think it would really be cool if EMADE took off in countries that speak different languages.) 
I'm taking classes in mathematical proof and algorithms, and I'm enjoying learning more about more formal language in mathematics and computer science (learning knew linguistic registers).
I'm passionate about neurobiology and especially humanity's quest to treat dementias.
