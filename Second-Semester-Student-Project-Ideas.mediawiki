This page is to spur ideas for student projects

Examples from their prior presentations/discussions:
* Removal of GP bloat
** Is bloat a good thing or a bad thing?  
** How much can it speed up evaluation?
** What methods exist now?
* Visualization of GP 
** What is the evolutionary process creating?  
** Why is it successfull?
* Visualization of evolutionary process
** What Operators (mating methods, mutation methods, settings) are important
* Improved speed of evaluation
** Could we use GPU's for some of our evaluators?
** Could we reuse previous calculations?
* Feature Selection
** Some machine learners seem to scale in speed based on the number of features
** How should we pick the best features?
* New data sets
** Is there a good set of canonical problems, i.e. problems that are showing up in the literature we could publish comparisons too?
** Are there new domains we would like to look at.
** Do you have some burning desire to look at a specific domain, e.g. medical imagery, autonomous vehicles etc.
* Mutation, selection, and crossover methods
** Are there additional methods in the literature?
** Do you have some "crazy" idea you would like to try?
