=== General Tasks ===
* Visuals
** Look into creating visuals (line graphs, candlestick charts, etc...) of the indicators and stock prices over time.
** This could be added as a new python script in testCode, look into mlp_finance module
* Parser
** Create a formal parser script to reformat common stock csv's to stream data classification format
** Add regression format capabilities to parser script
** Place in src/Parsers folder

=== Task Assignments ===
* [[Yalini Senthil Kumar]] and [[Guergana Plamenova Ilieva]]
** Extensive search and analysis of potential technicals for stock evaluation given our current data set
** Documentation of findings and processes via the team Wiki
* [[Jaswanth Sai Pyneni]] and Alen
** Programming of the technicals used for stock analysis as functional primitives within EMADE
** Data preprocessing for certain data sets
* [[User-Jrick6|James Rick]]
** Data preprocessing in order to ensure functionality with EMADE
** Current troubleshooting of EMADE

=== Tentative Schedule ===
