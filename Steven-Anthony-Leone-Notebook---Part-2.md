== Week 1 ==
* General Meeting Notes
** We discussed potential sub team ideas
**A brainstorming channel in the slack was created for the NLP sub team.
** I think exploring how AutoML can be used to explore more complex NLP problems, like machine translation, would be interesting, especially as machine translations require multiple qualities to score, making it a natural choice for a multi objective framework.
**I found a few papers on using AutoML for machine translation. They each express how AutoML hasn't been used much for machine translation, and neither of them used multiple objectives (both used BLEU).

** We held a brainstorming meeting. We decided that the issue of complexity was best left to the NAS team if we were splitting this semester.

== Week 2 ==
* General Meeting Notes
** During the general meeting, I informed the whole team of ideas discussed in our brainstorm meeting. Devan also suggested added more primitives for more than embeddings.
** The sub team for NLP was officially formed with members decided.
