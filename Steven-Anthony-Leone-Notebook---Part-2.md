## Week 1
### General Meeting Notes 
 * We discussed potential sub team ideas
 * A brainstorming channel in the slack was created for the NLP sub team.
 * I think exploring how AutoML can be used to explore more complex NLP problems, like machine translation, would be interesting, especially as machine translations require multiple qualities to score, making it a natural choice for a multi objective framework.
 * I found a few papers on using AutoML for machine translation. They each express how AutoML hasn't been used much for machine translation, and neither of them used multiple objectives (both used BLEU).
 * * https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9095246/ talks about using NAS for machine translation, without an evolutionary system (using gradients)
 * * http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/so19a.html talks about NAS for machine translation, with an evolutionary system
 * We held a brainstorming meeting. We decided that the issue of complexity was best left to the NAS team if we were splitting this semester.
