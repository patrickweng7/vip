== Goals ==
*Run optimization on multiple stocks to determine which indicators work best on which stocks.
*Analyze results to look for interesting combinations of indicators that could be fed to the portfolio team.
*Expand capabilities of EMADE by coding more technical indicators throughout the semester.

'''Potential Datasets:'''
* [https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news Two Sigma Kaggle Dataset]
'''Indicators:'''
* [https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/x-study/technical-indicator-definitions/list-of-technical-indicators/ List of Indicators]
* [[To Implement/Implemented for Fall 2018]]
* See link for regularly updated list: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13PCpUBzHhBUGKvpyjBB42WFvMkxVCWwOcNdpCDQLI_g/edit?usp=sharing
'''Tools:'''
* [https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/ API documentation for getting real-time stock data]
'''Method basis for seeded Individual:'''

* Problems to address:  Single stock price tends to be affected by large noise and long term trend inherently converges to the company’s market performance 
* Tested on AAPL, MSFT, AMZN 
* Indicators and reasons for use:  1)  Price change – ROCR, MOM   2)  Stock trend discovery – ADX, MFI   3)  Buy&Sell signals – WILLR, RSI, CCI, MACD   4)  Volatility signal – A TR   5)  Volume weights – OBV   6)  Noise elimination and data smoothing – TRIX 
* Cross validated Grid Search on parameters of rbf-kernelized SVM is performed to fit the training data to balance the bias and variances
* The fitting model is soft-margin SVM with RBF kernel exp(|x-p|/l). We have two parameter to fit C and l. For each training set, I do 5-fold cross-validation and grid search on parameter pair <C,l> and pick the best parameter to do validation on test set. 
* Results: able to achieve more than 70% accuracy on predicting a 3-10 day average price trend with RBF kernelized SVM algorithm

== Future Considerations/Goals: ==
# Experiment with bear markets instead of only bull markets
# Move from a classification to a regression problem
# Iterative testing and predictions (every 5 days or every day instead of ten day window)
# Add more relevant indicators
# Run on validation set
# Bloat removal (check existing indicators for relevancy)
