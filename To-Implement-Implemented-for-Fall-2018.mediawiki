<big>'''Johnny's Indicators:'''</big>

1. '''Triple Exponential Moving Average''' (T3)- Offers a moving average with better smoothing than traditional EMA. The formula is as follows:

EMA1 = EMA(x, Period)

EMA2 = EMA(EMA1, Period)

GD = EMA1*(1+vFactor)) - (EMA2*vFactor)

T3 = GD (GD ( GD(t, Period, vFactor), Period, vFactor), Period, vFactor)

<nowiki>**</nowiki>vFactor is a normalized factor between 0 and 1 that returns how the moving average responds (0 for EMA, 1 for DEMA). Literature and industry usage prefers ~0.7

2. '''Commodity Channel Index''' (CCI)- compares the current mean price with the average mean price over a typical window of 20 periods. Formula:

CCI = ( M - A ) / ( 0.015 * D ), where

M = ( H + L + C ) / 3

H = Highest price for the period

L = Lowest price for the period

C = Closing price for the period

A = n period moving average of M

D = mean deviation of the absolute value of the difference between the mean price and the moving average of mean prices, M - A

'''1. Chande Momentum Oscillator''' - https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/x-study/technical-indicator-definitions/chande-momentum-oscillator-cmo/

CMO = ((PosSum - NegSum) / (PosSum + NegSum)) * 100

PosSum = Sum of (Closecurrent- ClosePrevious) where (Closecurrent- ClosePrevious) is greater than zero

NegSum = Absolute value of the sum of (Closecurrent- ClosePrevious) where (Close current- Close Previous) is less than zero

'''2. MinMax''' - https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/x-study/technical-indicator-definitions/minmax-minmax/

MAX(Value1, Value2, …. ValueN) and MIN (Value1, Value2, …. ValueN) 

''N'' is the look back period

'''3. Double EMA -  https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/help/x-study/technical-indicator-definitions/double-exponential-moving-average-dema/'''

DEMA = ( 2 * EMA(n)) - (EMA(n) of EMA(n) )

Smoothed average with less lag than the normal exponential moving average
