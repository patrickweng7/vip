== About ==

My name is Anthony D'Achille, I am currently (as of Fall 2018) a 3rd-year computer science major with concentrations in intelligence and media. I have a passion for emerging technologies, which is why I joined the EMADE team. The group is working to create "an automated method that starts with the best human algorithms and then dispassionately develops hybrid algorithms that outperform existing methods." Within the team, I am working on creating visualizations for EMADE so that users can have a better understanding of EMADE, individual performance, and the evolution of the non-dominated front.

== Fall 2018 ==
In Fall 2018, we created the EMADE Viz team. Throughout the semester I had a few major roles within the team.
# As one of the project leads, I got the opportunity to create our Trello issue board, update our team's wiki, made our project's GitHub Repository, and work on our presentations.
# I created the initial Flask website template that we would use to hold all of the visualizations. I also did some basic styling for the website.
# I created the Individuals List visualization that allows a user to see the status of individuals in any given generation.
Next semester, I hope to improve the website UI (adding a tabular view of the visualizations), create more extensive documentation, and add visualizations.
