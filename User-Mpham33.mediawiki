I am interested in pursuing a Data Engineering career after I graduate, so I would really like to work on as much data related tasks as possible to get the experience I need for internships.

Accomplishments:

First Semester:
- Learned how to perform data preprocessing and data analytics on Titanic dataset.
- Applied Decision Tree classifier to predict the test dataset.
- Learned Genetic Programming and applied Genetic Programming to the Titanic dataset.
- Researched about EMADE and used the Genetic Programming Framework in EMADE to find the best algorithm.
- Researched about how to stream real-time data to a database and provide data to the Stock Portfolio team.

  Finished tasks:
  - Set up Firebase as a database to store data and stream data
  - Stream real-time data from GDAX

  What's next
  - Data processing module that can produce data points from smaller resolution to higher resolution.
  - Pipeline to transform data to fit with multiple learning algorithms.
  - Export data to different platforms.

Second Semester:
  Coming soon!
