==About==
My name is Wesley Cheung, I am currently (as of Fall 2018) a 4th-year computer science major with concentrations in intelligence and info-networking. The group is working to create "an automated method that starts with the best human algorithms and then dispassionately develops hybrid algorithms that outperform existing methods." Within the team, I am working on creating visualizations for EMADE so that users can have a better understanding of EMADE, individual performance, and the evolution of the non-dominated front.
==Fall 2018==
In Fall 2018, we created the EMADE Viz team. Throughout the semester I had a few major roles within the team.
#I led one of the subteams tasked with the project to create pareto front visualizations as well as the dynamic version which updates as EMADE runs
#I integrated the graphing visualizations with the pareto fronts to make a nice on-hover GUI.
#I introduced the settings endpoint so that users could set the database credentials dynamically rather than hard-coded in the application
